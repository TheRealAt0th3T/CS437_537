Palazzo Fraccia is a mansion located in the town centre of Alcamo, in the province of Trapani.

This palace was built by Agostino Fraccia, baron of Favarotta and Furni since 1697, in order to have a mansion fiiting to the new social position he had acquired from his noble family; it can certainly be considered one of the most beautiful civil buildings built in the 18th century in Alcamo.

On the Baroque style façade there are eight entrances on the ground floor: the central one is full of decorations; the portal, made with travertine, owing to the restoration of the road, has a raised bottom with simple pedestals, two capitals and a lowered arch (finely decorated at its arrises), surmounted by two brackets with leaf and fruit decorations, supporting the balcony of honour.

The portal of the balcony is also rich with baroque decorations, with two pilasters, other garnitures on both sides, ending with three masks, the biggest one in the middle; the family emblem dominates the tympanum: it is formed by a heart confixed by an arrow and surmounted by the baronial crown.

The other five balconies on the first floor are made with carved stone; the brackets are fluted and have some decorations; on the second floor there are five stone balconies, two windows and two recent balconies. 

As soon as you enter the lobby, there is an atrium: today, of the two ancient staircases, there is only the one leading to the first floor; in the late 19th century they built another staircase leading up to the second floor.

The palace is situated between the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari (along corso 6 Aprile) and via Porta Stella, where there are two other entrances on the first floor, leading to its eight rooms with accessories, and to the ten rooms existing on the second floor.

He previously worked as a Senior Fellow at Sentience Politics, and before that at Animal Charity Evaluators as Chair of the Board of Directors and then as a full-time researcher. His research focuses on the topics of for effective altruism, anti-speciesism, and plant-based and cellular agriculture. Reese was recognized as one of Vice’s “Humans of the Year” in December 2017 along with his co-founder Kelly Witwicki.

Sentience Institute is a nonprofit think tank working to understand and facilitate the expansion of humanity’s moral circle to all sentient beings. Since they were founded in June 2017, they have published several research reports including a study of the British antislavery movement, a study of the French nuclear power movement, and a poll of American attitudes towards “animal farming and animal-free food.” The poll was done in collaboration with Ipsos Group and was covered by media for results like that 47% of Americans support “a ban on slaughterhouses.” The organization receives its funding from individual donors and other charities like the Centre for Effective Altruism and the Effective Altruism Foundation.

Reese has also discussed the issue of wild animal suffering, arguing that humans should act on behalf of wild animals to alleviate their suffering if it can be done safely and effectively. His 2015 Vox article on the topic was criticized by writers who argued we shouldn’t intervene or that we should instead focus on helping domestic animals.

Sampur Soodaikudah archaeological site is a historic site with archaeological evidences, situated in Mathalamalai mountain, Sampur, Sri Lanka. The site was discovered by a group of archaeologists, during an archaeological excavation done in the Sampur area in December 2017. However the ruins, including an old Stupa were completely destroyed and flattened out by a group of vandals on 18 December, few days after the discovery.

During the Sri Lankan civil war, many of the archaeological sites in the North and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were not properly investigated or recorded as the prevailed threats from the LTTE rebel group. After the defeat of LTTE in 2009, the archaeology department carried out several projects across the North & Eastern provinces to investigate and identify the places with archaeological evidences and the some of places were finally declared as archaeologically protected reserves and monuments. As the instructions given by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a similar project was started after the 2015 to investigate the unknown archaeological sites in the Eastern province of the country. In December 2017, as a part of the project a group of archaeologists unearthed a dilapidated Stupa during an excavation done in a Hindu temple premises in Soodaikudah in Sampur. According to the initial evaluations done by the archaeologists, the Stupa is a construction of early Anuradhapura period (377 BC to 1017 AD) with a girth of 15 feet.

The ruins of the stupa were found on land which is used by a recently built Hindu shrine. The local people in Soodaikudah are said to be displaced in 2006 along with Muttur people and had been resettling around the area from 2013. The Hindu shrine, constructed near to the stupa mound, was officially registered in 2014.

A few days after the identification, the Stupa mound had been cleared completely by a group of people using a bulldozer before the Department declared it as an archaeologically and historically important site. The destruction was first revealed by police who conducted investigations following a tip-off given on the police hotline. The incident was reported to the authorities including the Secretary to the President and the Eastern Province Governor by the chief monk of Seruvila Mangala Raja Maha Vihara. A police investigation was started following the incident and meanwhile a court order was issued by the Muttur magistrate, suspending all rehabilitation works on the Hindu temple.

On 23 December, the speaker Karu Jayasuriya revealed that the people who destroyed the Soodaikudah Stupa in Sampur has been identified. A few days after the statement, three people were arrested with a bulldozer and a lorry which were used to destroy the Stupa. The bulldozer had been brought to the Hindu shrine to dig a drinking well around 100 metres away from the Kovil but they had used the vehicle to destroy the Stupa. Local media reported that the two drivers involved in the destruction of the Stupa had met with accidents at different places on the same day. 

On 29 December the Department of Archaeology announced that they will take over the entire land area, where the Sudaikuda Stupa was located for further preservation. In January police arrested three senior members of the Hindu temple board who had connected with the incident.",sampur stupa sampur soodaikudah archaeolog site histor site archaeolog evid situat mathalamalai mountain sampur sri lanka. site discov group archaeologist archaeolog excav sampur area decemb 2017. ruin includ stupa complet destroy flatten group vandal 18 decemb day discovery. sri lankan civil war archaeolog site north eastern provinc sri lanka properli investig record prevail threat ltte rebel group. defeat ltte 2009 archaeolog depart carri project north eastern provinc investig identifi place archaeolog evid place final declar archaeolog protect reserv monuments. instruct akila viraj kariyawasam project start 2015 investig unknown archaeolog site eastern provinc country. decemb 2017 project group archaeologist unearth dilapid stupa excav hindu templ premis soodaikudah sampur. initi evalu archaeologist stupa construct earli anuradhapura period 377 bc 1017 ad girth 15 feet. ruin stupa land built hindu shrine. local peopl soodaikudah displac 2006 muttur peopl resettl area 2013. hindu shrine construct stupa mound offici regist 2014. day identif stupa mound clear complet group peopl bulldoz depart declar archaeolog histor site. destruct reveal polic conduct investig polic hotline. incid report author includ secretari presid eastern provinc governor chief monk seruvila mangala raja maha vihara. polic investig start incid court order issu muttur magistr suspend rehabilit work hindu temple. 23 decemb speaker karu jayasuriya reveal peopl destroy soodaikudah stupa sampur identified. day statement peopl arrest bulldoz lorri destroy stupa. bulldoz brought hindu shrine dig drink 100 metr kovil vehicl destroy stupa. local medium report driver involv destruct stupa met accid place day. 29 decemb depart archaeolog announc entir land area sudaikuda stupa locat preservation. januari polic arrest senior member hindu templ board connect incident.

Under the circumstance of One China policy, Poland, like majority nations in the world, doesn't recognize Taiwan as a state but only recognizes China as the sole representative. Nonetheless, relationship between two countries have expanded dramatically, and since Poland transformed into a market economy after 1990, Taiwan has been one of largest Asian investors to Poland.

Despite this, they have their representative offices in respective countries. Poland has a representative office in Taipei while Taiwan has a representative office in Warsaw.

Poland and China had established relations following the resurgence of Poland at 1919, but two countries didn't develop a strong relationship due to remoteness. After communist takeovers of both Poland and mainland China, there had been no official diplomatic mission between two states. Communist Poland only considered the newly-established People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China, while the Taiwan-relocated Republic of China was hostile to all communist factors.

Mungret Abbey is a medieval friary and National Monument located in County Limerick, Ireland.

Mungret Abbey is located immediately west of Dooradoyle and northeast of Mungret College, southwest of Limerick city centre, to the south of the Shannon Estuary.

Mungret was an early monastic site, founded before AD 551 by Saint Nessan (Neasán) the Deacon. At one point there may have been as many as 1,500 monks and six churches operating.

John O'Donovan claimed a fourth-century date, predating Saint Patrick.

In 908, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King of Munster, gifted the abbey three ounces of gold and a satin chasuble.

It was plundered on four occasions in the 9th century by Vikings. High King Domnall Ua Lochlainn destroyed the monastery in 1107.

Mungret claimed episcopal status 1152, but was deemed to be too close to Limerick. 1179 the then king of Munster, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, granted the monastery to Brictius, Bishop of Limerick.

Mungret then became a parish church (built 1251−72), operated by the Augustinian Canons Regular.

Mungret Abbey church was used by the Church of Ireland until 1822. The antiquary Austin Cooper wrote about Mungret in 1781.

The building was extended and the tower, the priest's living quarters, was added during the 15th century.

On 21 December 1978, three British soldiers were shot dead when the Provisional IRA's South Armagh Brigade ambushed an eight-man British Army foot patrol in Crossmaglen, County Armagh.

Since the Troubles began the South Armagh area, especially around Crossmaglen, was one of the most dangerous places for the British security forces, and the IRA's South Armagh brigade carried out numerous ambushes on the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). This included the 1975 Drummuckavall ambush and the 1978 downing of a British Army Gazelle helicopter.

When the patrol was near St Patrick's Church, a red Royal Mail-type van fitted with armor plating drove past the patrol and came to a sudden stop. IRA members opened fire from the back of the van with an M60 machine gun and AR-15 rifles. The British soldiers returned fire but did not claim any hits. Christmas shoppers scrambled for cover. Three soldiers at the front of the patrol were fatally wounded. They were taken to Musgrave Park Hospital but were declared dead on arrival. The soldiers killed were Graham Duggan (22), Kevin Johnson (20) and Glen Ling (18).",1978 crossmaglen ambush 21 decemb 1978 british soldier shot dead provision ira south armagh brigad ambush man british armi foot patrol crossmaglen counti armagh. troubl begin south armagh area crossmaglen danger place british secur forc ira south armagh brigad carri numer ambush british armi royal ulster constabulari ruc . includ 1975 drummuckaval ambush 1978 down british armi gazel helicopter. patrol st patrick church red royal mail type van fit armor plat drove patrol sudden stop. ira member open van m60 machin gun ar 15 rifles. british soldier return claim hits. christma shopper scrambl cover. soldier patrol fatal wounded. musgrav park hospit declar dead arrival. soldier kill graham duggan 22 kevin johnson 20 glen ling 18 .

Dr. Shuhei Ono is an associate professor of earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In his research, he measures isotopes of sulfur and other elements to investigate water-rock-microbe interactions, seafloor hydrothermal systems, the deep biosphere, and global sulfur cycles.

Dr. Shuhei Ono earned his B.S. in geology in 1994 and his M.E. in economic geology in 1996 from Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan. He completed his Ph.D. in geochemistry from Pennsylvania State University in 2001. Ono joined the Geophysical Laboratory of Carnegie Institution of Washington to complete his postdoctoral research, and in 2006 received a geobiology fellowship from the Agouron Institute to support his work. In 2007, Ono became a faculty member at MIT.

Ono earned the 2017 Paul Gast Lectureship award from the European Association of Geochemistry, given to mid-career scientists who have made outstanding contributions to geochemistry.

Ono has developed an instrument that uses tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy to detect the ratio of different isotopes in a sample of methane, which can indicate the methane’s source. The instrument has enabled his group to discover the origins of methane from seafloor hot springs, and to understand the effects of microbial and atmospheric methane cycling on the isotopic composition of methane in a sample.

Ono’s team also measures sulfur isotopes to study how early microbial life impacted atmospheric and ocean chemistry. Specifically, they are looking at Archean rocks in South Africa and Western Australia that are 4 to 2.5 billion years old. They also are using sulfur isotopes to investigate sulfur cycling within mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent systems and sulfate reduction in the deep subsurface.

Additionally, Ono collaborates with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor of Atmospheric Science Ronald Prinn to explore the natural and environmental sources of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas and catalyst that destroys ozone.",shuhei ono dr. shuhei ono associ professor earth atmospher planetari scienc massachusett institut technology. measur isotop sulfur element investig water rock microb interact seafloor hydrotherm system deep biospher global sulfur cycles. dr. shuhei ono earn b.s. geolog 1994 m.e. econom geolog 1996 waseda univers tokyo japan. complet ph.d. geochemistri pennsylvania univers 2001. ono join geophys laboratori carnegi institut washington complet postdoctor 2006 receiv geobiolog fellowship agouron institut support work. 2007 ono faculti member mit. ono earn 2017 paul gast lectureship award european associ geochemistri mid career scientist outstand contribut geochemistry. ono develop instrument tunabl infrar laser direct absorpt spectroscopi detect ratio isotop sampl methan methane’ source. instrument enabl group discov origin methan seafloor hot spring understand effect microbi atmospher methan cycl isotop composit methan sample. ono’ team measur sulfur isotop studi earli microbi life impact atmospher ocean chemistry. archean rock south africa western australia 4 2.5 billion year old. sulfur isotop investig sulfur cycl mid ocean ridg hydrotherm vent system sulfat reduct deep subsurface. addit ono collabor massachusett institut technolog professor atmospher scienc ronald prinn explor natur environment sourc nitrou oxid power greenhous ga catalyst destroy ozone.

A schooner barge is a type of ship; a schooner converted as a barge. Schooner barges originated on the Great Lakes in the 1860's and were in use until World War II, although a few survived into the 1950s.

Even though steamboats were used for time-critical routes such as for passengers and mail, schooners were still economical to use for bulk cargoes such as grain, wood, or iron ore. Steam tugs were introduced on the Great Lakes that could tow one or more barges. Since old schooners were available, they could be adapted to towing service with reduced crews. When winds were favorable, the schooner barge could have one or two sails rigged to save fuel in the steam tug. Eventually schooner-rigged wooden ships were purposely built for use as barges. The concept was later extended to salt-water use, with, for example, the United States Navy converting some schooners for use as barges for coal. 

Because of rough weather and small crews, schooner barges were frequently lost from tows, set adrift during bad weather, or sunk. By the 1920's, schooner barges were no longer in practical use on the Great Lakes since steam and diesel powered ships provided better operating flexibility and safety, with lower crew costs than a tug and barges hauling the same amount of cargo.",schooner barg schooner barg type ship; schooner convert barge. schooner barg origin great lake 1860 war ii surviv 1950s. steamboat time critic rout passeng mail schooner econom bulk cargo grain wood iron ore. steam tug introduc great lake tow barges. schooner adapt tow servic reduc crews. wind favor schooner barg sail rig save fuel steam tug. eventu schooner rig wooden ship purpos built barges. concept extend salt water unit navi convert schooner barg coal. rough weather small crew schooner barg frequent lose tow set adrift bad weather sunk. 1920 schooner barg longer practic great lake steam diesel power ship oper flexibl safeti crew cost tug barg haul cargo.

He was named after the Scottish portraitist Henry Raeburn whom his father had known, and in later life he changed his surname in devotion to the celebrated portraitist. It was also an advantage to distinguish himself from the many members of his artistic family.

77,The Army of a Dream,78,militari,6,"The Army of a Dream

The Army of a Dream is a speculative fiction short story written by Rudyard Kipling, published in the Morning Post in June 1904. It models an alternate way of organizing the military, along lines of responsibility and competence instead of heredity and privilege, as he had seen that the British Military was at that time.

Using indirect exposition, Kipling conveys to the reader that the narrator is experiencing the story as a dream. The story itself involves a military man taking the narrator around and showing off his military unit, the ""Tynesiders"". It is revealed that in their society, military service is voluntary, but almost universal, because only those who have served may vote, along with a number of other incentives. Unlike military forces common through much of history, those of the story are not authoritarian or what one might otherwise call ""militaristic"", but are a sort of citizen militia composed of competent men focused on dealing with any threat to their community and nation.

Rudyard Kipling was, in general, a major influence on one of the 20th century's most influential writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In his seminal work Starship Troopers, Heinlein models a similar society, where one is not a citizen unless one becomes a veteran of government service. While this does not have to be in combat forces but is actually more like being a civil servant, that novel follows characters in the mobile infantry, and is in fact the origin of the mech trope that has pervaded science fiction since. Also foreshadowed is Heinlein's fondness for the competent hero, a character who — though usually bearing normal human flaws — is rugged and self-responsible, able to do most things at least on a fundamental level and functioning with a high level of confidence and self-actualization.",armi dream armi dream specul fiction short stori write rudyard kipl publish morn post june 1904. model altern organ militari line respons compet hered privileg british militari time. indirect exposit kipl convey reader narrat experi stori dream. stori involv militari man narrat show militari unit tynesid . reveal societi militari servic voluntari univers serv vote number incentives. militari forc common histori stori authoritarian militarist sort citizen militia compos compet men focu deal threat commun nation. rudyard kipl gener major influenc 20th centuri influenti writer robert a. heinlein. semin work starship trooper heinlein model societi citizen veteran govern service. combat forc civil servant charact mobil infantri fact origin mech trope pervad scienc fiction since. foreshadow heinlein fond compet hero charact — bear normal human flaw — rug respons fundament level function high level confid actualization.

Elmer S. Rigdon (June 16, 1868-December 13, 1922) was a member of the California State Senate from Cambria, California. He was the key proponent for building the Carmel-San Simeon Highway along the Big Sur coast. He was a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways and during World War I promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast. He persuaded the legislature to approve the project. In 1919, the legislature approved submission of a bond measure to voters. 

He was the son of Rufus Rigdon and Indiana Scott Rigdon. His parents homesteaded in Cambria during the 1860s. Elmer Rigdon became a rancher and timber harvester. He also owned a brickyard in Cambria and the Bank Mine on San Simeon Creek. He extracted quicksilver from the mine from 1903 to 1906, when he sold his interest. He was elected to the California state assembly in 1914 and to the state senate in 1916.

Dr. John L. D. Roberts, who founded Seaside, California, had a strong interest in building a road along the California central coast. In 1897, he walked the entire stretch of rocky coast from from Monterey to San Luis Obispo in five days and mapped out the course of the future road. He photographed the land and became the first surveyor of the route. In 1915, he presented the results of his survey and photographic work to a joint session of the California legislature. Roberts initially promoted the coastal highway to allow access to a region of spectacular beauty, but failed to obtain funding. Rigdon embraced the necessity of building the road. As a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways during World War I, he promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast and persuaded the legislature to support the project. The $1.5 million bond issue was approved by voters, but construction was delayed by World War I. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds.

Rigdon died in office before the highway was completed. At the dedication of the highway on On June 27, 1937, his wife dedicated a silver fir to her husband's memory. A small park and drinking fountain in a turnout between Vicente Creek Bridge and Big Creek Bridge, north of Lucia. was dedicated as the Elmer Rigdon Memorial Drinking Fountain.",elmer s. rigdon elmer s. rigdon june 16 1868 decemb 13 1922 member california senat cambria california. key propon build carmel san simeon highway big sur coast. member california senat committe road highway war promot militari necess defend california coast. persuad legislatur approv project. 1919 legislatur approv submiss bond measur voters. son rufu rigdon indiana scott rigdon. parent homestead cambria 1860s. elmer rigdon rancher timber harvester. own brickyard cambria bank san simeon creek. extract quicksilv 1903 1906 sell interest. elect california assembl 1914 senat 1916. dr. john l. d. robert found seasid california strong build road california central coast. 1897 walk entir stretch rocki coast monterey san lui obispo day map futur road. photograph land surveyor route. 1915 present survey photograph work joint session california legislature. robert initi promot coastal highway access region spectacular beauti fail funding. rigdon embrac necess build road. member california senat committe road highway war promot militari necess defend california coast persuad legislatur support project. 1.5 million bond issu approv voter construct delay war i. feder fund appropri 1921 voter approv addit funds. rigdon die offic highway completed. dedic highway june 27 1937 wife dedic silver fir husband memory. small park drink fountain turnout vicent creek bridg big creek bridg north lucia. dedic elmer rigdon memori drink fountain.

The Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC, was extended from Chou’s Pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC . Both PseAAC and PseKNC are of vector descriptor, but the former represents protein or peptide sequences while the latter represents DNA or RNA sequences. 

To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information for protein and peptide sequences, the pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC was proposed by Kuo-Chen Chou. But how about for DNA and RNA sequences? To address this problem, the pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC was proposed. For the convenience scientific community, a freely available web server, called PseKNC and an open source package, called PseKNC-General were developed in 2013 and 2014, which could convert large-scale sequence datasets to pseudo nucleotide compositions with numerous choices of physicochemical property combinations. PseKNC-General can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions, Moreau–Broto autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coefficient,Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC. 

Like PseAAC in computational proteomics and proteome analysis, PseKNC has also been increasingly used in computational genomics and performing various genome analyses.",pseudo tupl nucleotid composit pseudo tupl nucleotid composit pseknc extend chou’ pseudo amino acid composit pseaac . pseaac pseknc vector descriptor repres protein peptid sequenc repres dna rna sequences. avoid complet lose sequenc order protein peptid sequenc pseudo amino acid composit pseaac propos kuo chen chou. dna rna sequences? address problem pseudo tupl nucleotid composit pseknc proposed. conveni scientif commun freeli web server call pseknc open sourc packag call pseknc gener develop 2013 2014 convert larg scale sequenc dataset pseudo nucleotid composit numer choic physicochem properti combinations. pseknc gener gener mode pseudo nucleotid composit includ convent tupl nucleotid composit moreau broto autocorrel coeffici moran autocorrel coeffici geari autocorrel coeffici type pseknc type ii pseknc. pseaac comput proteom proteom analysi pseknc increasingli comput genom perform genom analyses.

The men's slalom competition of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics will be held on 22 February 2018 at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre at the Alpensia Sports Park in PyeongChang.

A total of up to 320 alpine skiers qualified across all eleven events. Athletes qualified for this event by having met the A qualification standard, which meant having 140 or less FIS Points and being ranked in the top 500 in the Olympic FIS points list or meeting the B standard, which meant 140 or less FIS points. Countries not meeting the A standard were allowed to enter a maximum of one B standard athlete per gender. The Points list takes into average the best results of athletes per discipline during the qualification period (July 1, 2016 to January 21, 2018). Countries received additional quotas by having athletes ranked in the top 30 of the 2017–18 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup (two per gender maximum, overall across all events). After the distribution of B standard quotas (to nations competing only in the slalom and giant slalom events), the remaining quotas were distributed using the Olympic FIS Points list, with each athlete only counting once for qualification purposes. A country could only enter a maximum of four athletes for the event.

The race will be started at 10:15 (Run 1) and 13:45 (Run 2).",alpin ski 2018 winter olymp men slalom men slalom competit pyeongchang 2018 olymp held 22 februari 2018 yongpyong alpin centr alpensia sport park pyeongchang. total 320 alpin skier qualifi events. athlet qualifi event met qualif standard meant 140 fi point rank 500 olymp fi point list meet standard meant 140 fi points. countri meet standard allow enter maximum standard athlet gender. point list take averag athlet disciplin qualif period juli 1 2016 januari 21 2018 . countri receiv addit quota athlet rank 30 2017 18 fi alpin ski cup gender maximum event . distribut standard quota nation compet slalom giant slalom event remain quota distribut olymp fi point list athlet count qualif purposes. countri enter maximum athlet event. race start 10 15 1 13 45 2 .

104,Glan Blies Way,105,glan,10,"Glan-Blies Way

The Glan-Blies Way () is a long distance cycle route and hiking trail that is 130 kilometres long. It begins in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate at Staudernheim on the River Nahe, follows the course of the Glan, crosses the state of Saarland along the Blies and finishes in Lorraine. 

The way begins on the Nahe Cycleway. Running past Disibodenberg Abbey and then making its way via Odernheim am Glan and Meisenheim it reaches the Kusel Musikantenland. In the Veldenz town of Lauterecken there is a railway connexion and the option to switch onto the Lauter Valley Cycleway to Kaiserslautern. A few kilometres further on, the trail passes Offenbach-Hundheim and the old Benedictine Provost Church of St. Mary. It then continues initially in a southwesterly direction, then swings south to Altenglan. At Altenglan, a junction with the Fritz-Wunderlich Way runs through Kusel on an old railway trackbed to Freisen. Between Altenglan and Staudernheim, there is a separate draisine route that runs through the Glan valley. The cycleway continues for two kilometres alongside the federal highway.
Between Glan-Münchweiler and Niedermohr the Barbarossa Cycleway branches off, running through North Palatinate to Worms. From Glan-Münchweiler the route follows the old trackbed of the Glan Valley Railway via Nanzdietschweiler, with its old washing facility and the preserved mill from 1884, through the Elschbach Tunnel. It continues past the lake of Ohmbachsee to Schönenberg-Kübelberg, where it passes the protected railway station. Next, the way passes Waldmohr with its bog mill and the Eichelscheiderhof. Here it leaves the route of the railway and follows cycle tracks to Homburg. 

After Beeden the way runs along the River Blies through the Bliesgau Biosphere Reserve. In Wörschweiler, a detour goes to the abbey ruins and the Schwarzenacker Roman Museum. On the next stage, the route reaches Blieskastel with its baroque ""Altstadt"". The route runs along the old embankment of the Blies Valley Railway. The last station on German soil is the Bliesbruck-Reinheim European Culture Park, with a Celtic prince's grave and settlement from the Roman era. Here the way crosses the Franco-German border and comes to an end after Saargemünd (French: ""Sarreguemines"") at the confluence of the Blies and the Saar. 

In Sarreguemines the Glan-Blies Way is joined from the north by the Saar Cycleway, which runs between Sarreguemines and Völklingen parallel to the Saarland Cycleway. To the south is a junction with the cycling path along the Saar Canal and thus to the French cycle network.

The bidirectional way is signposted throughout. The waymarks along the route give the distances and destinations as well as the logo of the way. The multicoloured logo depicts a beckoning cyclist and bears the inscription ""Glan-Blies-Weg"".

119,Nairobi College,120,colleg,13,"Nairobi College

Nairobi College was a small radical left junior college in East Palo Alto, California for ethnic minority students in the late 1960s.

The College was part of a movement for ethnic minority groups in the United States to have dedicated academic programs to train themselves in the theory and practice of liberation, resistance, and revolution. These programs were referred to as ""Third world colleges"", which sought to practice the principles of self-determination and community empowerment while teaching left-radical ideology in rejection of the perceived bourgeois ideology and white control of mainstream academic institutions. Prominent advocates for this movement included graduate student Angela Davis and professors Herbert Marcuse of the University of California San Diego and Carlos Blanco of Thurgood Marshall College. Other colleges founded as part of this movement included Malcolm X Liberation University, Uhuru Sasa Shule, the Center for Black Education, and Thurgood Marshall College.

Nairobi College began classes in the fall of 1960 with initial funding of $100,000 donated by area residents and private foundations.. 20,000 books were donated by schools, individuals, and publishers, which were kept in two residential garages. Anyone at least 16 years of age was welcome to enroll at no cost. The first class had working-class 100 students, some of whom were high school dropouts. The all-volunteer faculty numbered about 40 and consisted of student and professors from nearby universities as well as community organizers.
Based out of a small private home in East Palo Alto, Nairobi College operated out of stores, church buildings, and homes throughout black, Latino, and Asian neighborhoods in the San Francisco Peninsula.
The college leadership hoped that spreading classes out in these existing structures would integrate it with the needs and reality of their surrounding community, calling it a ""college without walls"" in contrast to the perceived ""ivory tower"" of mainstream academia. It was a two-year college.

The students were primarily African American and Hispanic, although working-class white students were also included. Most of them worked full time and took classes in the evenings. All students were required to utilize their training to provide skilled volunteer work three hours per week in support of area social organizations, such as schools, community health centers, and legal aid.

Instructors included Ed Roberts, a disability rights activist, Tello Nkhereanye, a leftist from South Africa, Frank Omowale Satterwhite, a community organizer, Aaron Manganello, a Marxist minister of education for the Brown Berets, and Mary Hoover, a Stanford academic advocate for African-American English.

The Corral del Coliseo is an old corral de comedias (a Spanish theatre) of 16th century in Seville (Andalusia, Spain), near the Plaza de la Encarnación square, which was later converted into a corral of neighbors and is currently is used as a residential building.

It has been documented that in March of 1612, ""Claramonte"" directs the Corral del Coliseo in Seville, and promises to provide the Company with ""eight old or already premiered comedies for four hundred reales, and new or never seen, at a rate of 250 reales"". It is also known that in 1620, ""Ortiz y los Valencianos"" represented the work of ""Claramonte"" ""The Great King of the Deserts"" in the Corral del Coliseo. In this same year the Corral del Coliseo suffered a devastating fire.

A lawsuit in 1619 between the owner of the Corral del Coliseo and some authors of comedies also serves as a guide to understand the society of the time. The complaint was lodged by Francisco de Rivera, landlord of the Corral del Coliseo, on June 5, 1619, before Juan Muñoz de Escovar, """"of the Council and Accountant major of accounts of His Majesty, Judge of the Performance of this city of Seville"""", against Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo (both authors of comedies), because they decided to represent the autos sacramentales of Corpus Christi in the ""Corral de doña Elvira"". With this, they contravened a previous resolution, of May 25, of the same judge in which he arranged to be represented in the Corral del Coliseo.

The Warakamai, now more frequently known as the Warrgamay, are an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland.

Their language, Warrgamay, is now extinct. It was a variety of Dyirbalic, and appears to be composed of three distinct dialects:""Wargamaygan"" spoken around the lower reaches of the Herbert River; ""Biyay"" spoken at the mouth of the Herbert, in the area of Halifax and Bemerside; and ""Hinchinbrook Biyay,"" spoken around the coastal area south of Cardwell and offshore on Hinchinbrook Island.

The Warakamai were the indigenous people of Halifax Bay, and held in Norman Tindale's calculations, approximately of tribal domains. An early resident, James Cassady, specified that they had 50 miles of shortline extending into the hinterland approximately 15 miles. Their northern neighbours were the Girramay, while to their south lay the Wulgurukaba.

The Warakamai were divided into several hordes:

The intermarriage of groups has been classified as follows:

Circumcision as an initiatory rite was unknown among the Warakamai. They did practice tooth avulsion, ritual scarification and piercing of the septum to wear nose bones. Polygamy was common, and widows were married to their deceased husband's brother.

The area of Halifax Bay first began to be settled by white colonialists in 1865. At that time the numbers of Warakami were estimated to amount to roughly 500 people. Within 15 years, they had declined by 300, a mere 40 of the surviving 200 being men. The difference was due to their being relentlessly hunted and gunned down by mounted native troopers under white supervision, together with settlers, both of whom 'shot as many of the males of the tribe as possible.'",warakamai warakamai frequent warrgamay indigen australian peopl queensland. languag warrgamay extinct. varieti dyirbal appear compos distinct dialect wargamaygan spoken reach herbert river; biyay spoken mouth herbert area halifax bemerside; hinchinbrook biyay spoken coastal area south cardwel offshor hinchinbrook island. warakamai indigen peopl halifax bay held norman tindal calcul tribal domains. earli resid jame cassadi 50 mile shortlin extend hinterland 15 miles. northern neighbour girramay south lay wulgurukaba. warakamai divid hord intermarriag group classifi circumcis initiatori rite unknown warakamai. practic tooth avuls ritual scarif pierc septum wear nose bones. polygami common widow marri deceas husband brother. area halifax bay begin settl white colonialist 1865. time number warakami estim roughli 500 people. 15 year declin 300 mere 40 surviv 200 men. differ relentlessli hunt gun mount nativ trooper white supervis settler shot male tribe possible.

Vera Fonaroff (June 14, 1883, Kiev - July 23, 1962, New York, NY) was an American classical violinist and violin teacher of Russian-Jewish heritage.

Born in Kiev on June 14, 1883, to Alexander and Sonia Hochstein, the family immigrated to the United States in 1900. In 1905 she married Mark Fonaroff, a fellow Russian emigrant who was also her violin teacher. They had two daughters. Olga Fonaroff (1910-1933) was mentally handicapped. Nina Fonaroff (1914-2003) became a dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company.

At nine years old, Fonaroff debuted as a violin soloist with the Metropolitan Opera House Orchestra, and thereafter made frequent solo appearances. After a period in Engand, studying and touring as a soloist and recitalist with the pianist Richard Epstein, she returned to New York to study with Franz Kneisel. 
In 1909, Fonaroff joined the all-woman Olive Mead String Quartet as second violinist.

In 1923, Fonaroff began teaching at the Juilliard School. From 1926 to 1939 and 1948 to 1955, she taught violin, and she was director of violin instruction from 1924 to 1930.

Peter Henry Jones (1 March 1917 – 30 July 1984), was born in Monmouth and is best known for his role in assisting Sir Clement Price Thomas in the pneumonectomy of King George VI in 1951. 

He subsequently remained professionally close to Price Thomas, pursuing a career in Cardiothoracic surgery.
Jones was educated in Pontypool at Haberdashers' Aske's West Monmouth School.

Qualifying in medicine from Westminster Hospital Medical School in 1939, Jones stayed on at the hospital to complete his junior house posts. Between 1942 and 1946, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a regimental medical officer to a field artillery regiment in North Africa and Italy. He witnessed the Salerno landing and the attack on Monte Cassino. Declining an elevation in rank, he opted to endure the rest of the war along with his regiment. Returning to England in 1946, Jones continued his surgical training and passed the FRCS in 1948. Afterwards, he joined the surgical team under Sir Clement Price Thomas at the Brompton Hospital and Westminster Hospitals.

Baguley and Davyhulme Hospitals appointed Jones as thoracic surgeon in 1955 and Manchester Royal Infirmary took him on in 1960. Also, in 1960, Jones attended the Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco to learn new techniques in open heart surgery. After spending six months with Dr Frank Gerbode, he returned to Westminster Hospital as thoracic surgeon. 

As Hunterian Professor, he gave a lecture on bronchial sleeve resection in 1958. 

In 1951, Jones spent three weeks as resident surgeon in Buckingham Palace. On 23 September 1951, whilst still in the palace, he had assisted Price Thomas with the pneumonectomy on King George VI’s lung cancer. In return, he was awarded the MVO. The surgery has since been researched and re-enacted by real surgeons in Stephen Daldry's The Crown (TV series).

141,Facing It,142,poem vietnam,10,"Facing It

""Facing It"" is a poem by American poet and author Yusef Komunyakaa. It is a reflection on Komunyakaa's first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970, during which time he wrote for army newspaper ""Southern Cross"". It is the second poem written by Komunyakaa about Vietnam. R. S. Gwynn has referred to the poem as “the most poignant elegy that has been written about the Vietnam War.” 

The poem was his second to deal with the topic of the Vietnam War. He first wrote a poem dealing with Vietnam fourteen years after returning from the war. ""Facing It"" was written approximately a year after visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa has said ""Facing It"" influenced the other poems of the collection in which it was first published, ""Dien Cai Dau"".

The poem concerns the speaker's visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a black gabbro wall engraved with the names of American soldiers who died in the war. The wall is polished so that it is reflective.

Like jazz, the poem appears to be free of form, but it is in fact split into a verse-bridge-verse structure similar to many jazz songs. The first thirteen lines reflect on the speaker's reaction, and the final thirteen reflect on the reactions of others; these two sections are separated by a shorter section describing the act of finding and touching a name.

The poem is one of several by Vietnam veterans to deal with memorials. Andrew Palmer and Sally Minogue have contrasted the ""ambivalent response"" of ""Facing It"" with W. D. Ehrhart's ""The Invasion of Grenada"", in which the speaker rejects the idea of a Vietnam memorial and refuses to engage with ""...that
vast black wall of broken lives"".

Agnes Oxenbridge (died August 4, 1480) and Elizabeth Etchingham (died December 3, 1452) have a joint memorial brass on the floor of the side aisle of The Assumption of Blessed Mary and St Nicholas church at Etchingham, England. The brass is in front of the monument to Etchingham's ancestors. The Latin inscription under Elizabeth Etchingham identifies her as the first daughter of Thomas and Margaret Etchingham. The text under Agnes Oxenbridge identifies her as the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge. Both Judith M. Bennett in ""The Lesbian Premodern"" than Alan Bray in ""Homosexuality in Renaissance England"" recognized the memorial brass like those made for a married couple and therefore think that the one between Oxenbridge and Etchingham was a particular friendship, probably a medieval example of Lesbian relationship.

Elizabeth Etchingham was the daughter of Thomas Etchingham II (1424/25 - 1486) and Margaret West, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr. The monument to Thomas Etchingham I and his parents is in front of the memorial brass of his granddaughter.

Serranus was the son of Lucius Nonius Asprenas, ordinary consul of AD 6 and Calpurnia L. Pisonis f., the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus consul in 15. He is known to have two brothers, Lucius Nonius Asprenas suffect consul in AD 29, and Nonius Asprenas Calpurnius Torquatus.

Only one event is known of his life. On the morning that the emperor Caligula was assassinated, while offering a sacrifice Serranus had gotten some blood on his garments. Later that day, when Caligula had been murdered, the emperor's German bodyguards sought his assassin with their swords drawn. The first person they encountered was Serranus, and assuming the blood on his clothes was human summarily slew him. Then they cut off his head and, with those assassins they had found and killed, paraded about with it.

Sabatino ""Sammy"" Nicolucci (born 1946/47) is an Italian-Canadian mobster linked to the Sicilian Rizzuto crime family based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Nicolucci's first criminal conviction in Canada came in 1973 for drug possession, followed by possessing $2 million of counterfeit money in 1978. Nicolucci became a confidante of Vito Rizzuto, who went on a trip to Venezuela in 1984 where they met the allied Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan, regarded as drug specialists. That same year, a probe into Nicolucci's drug trafficking by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found 12 kilograms of cocaine at Vancouver International Airport in false bottom suitcases intended for pick up by Montreal associate William Papier. The RCMP kept close surveillance on Nicolucci and Papier in Montreal through wiretaps, and even followed them by plane to Caracas, Venezuela where they received help from the United States Embassy in Venezuela, and bugged the mobsters hotel rooms. In 1985, the RCMP amassed enough evidence on Nicolucci and Papier, and the two were convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in Montreal Superior Court in relation to the Vancouver haul; they appealed, but the verdict was upheld.

In 1991, serving less than half his sentence, Nicolucci was released on parole. Within months of Nicolucci's release, he was money laundering, moving $31 million through a phony currency exchange in Montreal secretly run by the RCMP in an elaborate sting operation. Officers traced a $1.7-million purchase of 280 kilograms of cocaine made by Nicolucci on behalf of Vito Rizzuto. However, Nicolucci refused to pay the debt to the Colombian Cali cartel, claiming the cocaine was of poor quality. As a result, the Colombians kidnapped Nicolucci from Castel Tina on August 2, 1994, a Montreal strip club he managed, and smuggled him across the border to Miami, Florida, and then into Colombia. With an international warrant for Nicolucci's arrest, the Colombian police found Nicolucci in a house in Cali, Colombia in February 1995. He was extradited back to Canada and brought back to Montreal on May 30, 1996. Nicolucci was found guilty of 437 charges for drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to 19 years in prison.

Nicolucci was paroled on Statutory Release in 2012. In September 2017, the Parole Board of Canada forbid Nicolucci from Montreal's Little Italy, as well as ""Italian-style"" coffee shops or establishments that are recognized by the police as being a meeting point for members of Italian organized crime.""",sabatino nicolucci sabatino sammi nicolucci born 1946 47 italian canadian mobster link sicilian rizzuto crime famili base montreal quebec canada. nicolucci crimin convict canada 1973 drug possess possess 2 counterfeit money 1978. nicolucci confidant vito rizzuto trip venezuela 1984 met alli cuntrera caruana mafia clan regard drug specialists. year probe nicolucci drug traffic royal canadian mount polic rcmp 12 kilogram cocain vancouv intern airport fals suitcas intend pick montreal associ william papier. rcmp close surveil nicolucci papier montreal wiretap plane caraca venezuela receiv unit embassi venezuela bug mobster hotel rooms. 1985 rcmp amass evid nicolucci papier convict sentenc 14 year prison montreal superior court relat vancouv haul; appeal verdict upheld. 1991 serv sentenc nicolucci releas parole. month nicolucci releas money launder move 31 phoni currenc exchang montreal secretli rcmp elabor sting operation. offic trace 1.7 purchas 280 kilogram cocain nicolucci behalf vito rizzuto. nicolucci refus pay debt colombian cali cartel claim cocain poor quality. result colombian kidnap nicolucci castel tina august 2 1994 montreal strip club manag smuggl border miami florida colombia. intern warrant nicolucci arrest colombian polic nicolucci hous cali colombia februari 1995. extradit canada brought montreal 30 1996. nicolucci guilti 437 charg drug traffic money launder sentenc 19 year prison. nicolucci parol statutori releas 2012. septemb 2017 parol board canada forbid nicolucci montreal itali italian style coffe shop establish recogn polic meet point member italian organ crime.

Colin Robertson (born 1983), known as Millennial Woes or simply Woes, is a Scottish alt-right, neoreactionary political activist, blogger and YouTube personality. He describe himself as a neoreactionary and ""white advocate"", and openly identifies with the alt-right. He has been described as a far-right, white nationalist, white supremacist, ""garden-variety"" racist across media, and frequently publishes content that is critical of multiculturalism. He has been described as a ""household name"" and a ""darling"" of the alt-right, as well as a ""rising star of the movement"".

Woes attended a London art college in Tooting in the mid-2000s, an experience he describes as 'dizzying' due to the ethnic diversity of the school and district. After a period of clinical depression, unemployment and underemployment, he launched his YouTube channel at the end of 2013. ""Vice"" had labeled his platform a ""popular alt-right YouTube channel"" towards the end of 2016, with around 18,000 subscribers and 2.4 million views.

In November 2016, Woes delivered a speech at the National Policy Institute Conference 2017, in Washington DC. According to some media, his involvement was directly linked to then President-elect Donald Trump's disavowing of NPI. A few days after Trump's election, Woes spoke in Seattle, claiming that he did not believe the President-elect was a ""rabid white nationalist"", but that ""restor[ing] America"" may mean getting ""more white people here and fewer brown people"".

In January 2017, he began receiving coverage from BBC News and national newspapers, after Scottish tabloid the ""Daily Record"" claimed to have doxxed Millenial Woes, ""expos[ing]"" his birth name, family's home address and sending reporters to confront him. Woes was reported to have ""left Britain"", posting a video to his Youtube channel named ""Fugitive Woes"". UK-based Civil rights group Civil Liberty defended him, claiming the doxxing was a ""hate campaign fomented by ""[The] Daily Mirror"""", while men's issues blog Return of Kings claimed British ""media outlets"" were ""attempting to incite a mob against him"".

On 6 February 2017, he gave a speech entitled """"Withnail and I as Viewed From the Right"""" at The London Forum in Kensington, which ""The Independent"" described as ""a meeting of prominent far-right voices"". Hope Not Hate covered his appearance at the event, claiming he recited the Fourteen Words as part of his speech. On 25 February 2017, Woes gave a speech in Stockholm organised by , which had been promoted as ""the most important alt-right conference in Europe"". According to IBTimes, the event took place in a ""secret location"" in Södermalm. In August 2017, ""Salon"" claimed that Millennial Woes was one of only a few alt-right platforms to rapidly grow, alongside Red Ice, VDARE and The Rebel Media.

On 10 December 2017, according to Right Wing Watch he began a interview series named ""Millenniyule 2017"", interviewing various internet personalities from the alt-right movement, including an appearance from Faith Goldy.

Woes is a follower of the white genocide conspiracy theory, and it has been reported as ""central to his beliefs"". He has been described in media as an anti-Semite, and identified himself as one.

Kurt Selchow (born 28 May 1886 in Oppeln, Upper Silesia, Germany) was a Minister () and Director of the Z Branch, the Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office () before and during World War II. 

His father was Hugo Selchow. His wife was Erna Selchow and he had one daughter called Gitta. He was educated in Oppeln until 1906 when he became a soldier. He was initially assigned to the Infantry, then in 1912 he was transferred to Signal Corps (""Nachrichten Telegrafen Bataillon"") in Frankfurt (Oder). 

He served with the German Army of World War I as a signal officer with the troop. Selchow stated that even in the midst of World War I, he pointed out to the Chief Signal Office that much of the work being done in the German Army Signal Corps belonged properly to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs because of its diplomatic nature. The Chief Signal Officer did not agree with this statement and during World War I much of the work done by the Army was diplomatic in nature. Directly after the war, Selchow entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he organized the cipher bureau. He brought with him several soldiers who had been with him during World War I. These were Schauffler, Paschke, Zastrow, Brandes, Hoffman and Kunze. He is listed as a Principal Foreign Office Specialist (""Vortragender Legationsrat"") on November 1, 1935, with the rank of Minister in 1945. In mid-April 1947, Selchow moved to Wedel in Hamburgh. After the war Selchow maintained contact with some of his colleagues. Little is known about his abilities, but statements from personnel in other cipher bureaus imply that he was jealous and secretive. His Pers Z S staff characterized him as a ""competent administrator"" who knew little about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Selchow was somewhat of a Europhile and detested the Nazi Party. With the advent of Adolf Hitler in 1933 and Hermann Göring's Forschungsamt cipher bureau encroached upon the field of the Pers Z S, which was the interception and processing of diplomatic ciphers.

167,Garlic oil,168,garlic,27,"Garlic oil

Garlic oil is the volatile oil (essential oil) derived from garlic. It is usually prepared using steam distillation, and can also be produced via distillation using ether. It is used in cooking and as a seasoning, a nutritional supplement, and also as an insecticide.

Garlic oil is typically prepared using steam distillation, whereby crushed garlic is steamed with the resultant condensation containing the oil. Garlic oil contains volatile sulfur compounds such as diallyl disulfide, which is the ""most abundant constituent"" of essential garlic oil. Steam-distilled garlic oil typically has a pungent odor and a yellow-brownish coloration. Its odor has been attributed to the presence of diallyl disulfide. To produce around 1 g of pure steam-distilled garlic oil, around 500 g garlic is required. Steam-distilled garlic oil has around 900 times the strength of fresh garlic, and around 200 times the strength of dehydrated garlic.

Ether can also be used to extract garlic oil. A type of garlic oil involves soaking diced or crushed garlic in vegetable oil, but this is not pure garlic oil; rather it is a garlic-infused oil.

Garlic oil is used as a nutritional supplement, and is sometimes purveyed in the form of capsules, which may be diluted with other ingredients. Some commercial preparations are produced with various levels of dilution, such as a preparation that contains 10% garlic oil. Some herbal folklore sources have stated that garlic oil possesses antifungal and antibiotic properties. It is also purveyed in health food stores as a digestive aid.

It can also be used as an insecticide, whereby it is diluted with water and sprayed on plants.

Stabilized garlic flavor blend is a proprietary mixture of dehydrated garlic powder infused with garlic oil, which increases the flavor of the garlic powder.

Garlic-flavored oil is produced and used for cooking and seasoning purposes, and is sometimes used as an ingredient in seasoning mixtures. This differs from essential garlic oil, and typically involves the use of chopped, macerated or crushed garlic placed in various vegetable oils to flavor the oil.",garlic oil garlic oil volatil oil essenti oil deriv garlic. prepar steam distil produc distil ether. cook season nutrit supplement insecticide. garlic oil typic prepar steam distil crush garlic steam result condens oil. garlic oil volatil sulfur compound diallyl disulfid abund constitu essenti garlic oil. steam distil garlic oil typic pungent odor yellow brownish coloration. odor attribut presenc diallyl disulfide. produc 1 pure steam distil garlic oil 500 garlic required. steam distil garlic oil 900 time strength fresh garlic 200 time strength dehydr garlic. ether extract garlic oil. type garlic oil involv soak dice crush garlic veget oil pure garlic oil; garlic infus oil. garlic oil nutrit supplement purvey form capsul dilut ingredients. commerci prepar produc level dilut prepar 10 garlic oil. herbal folklor sourc state garlic oil poss antifung antibiot properties. purvey health food store digest aid. insecticid dilut water spray plants. stabil garlic flavor blend proprietari mixtur dehydr garlic powder infus garlic oil increas flavor garlic powder. garlic flavor oil produc cook season purpos ingredi season mixtures. differ essenti garlic oil typic involv chop macer crush garlic veget oil flavor oil.

John Primrose (c. 1803 – 28 November 1876) was a Scottish distiller and brewer who had a substantial career in South Australia. He was the founder of the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, the colony's first successful brewery.

Primrose was the son of a distiller in Cambridge, near Alloa. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, and on leaving school he joined his father's establishment, where he remained for some time, gaining sound practical and scientific knowledge of the arts of brewing and distilling. He gained further experience managing a distillery for the Messrs. Shea, of Belfast, then that of Beamish, in Cork. He remained with them for several years, only leaving them to establish a brewery on his own account on the Isle of Man.
He was then attracted to Australia, with the prospect of managing a large established distillery in Sydney.

Primrose arrived in South Australia aboard ""Ariadne"" in August 1839 and somehow never made it to Sydney. 
Shortly after his arrival he set up a distillery in partnership with John Richmond. 
After carrying it on for about two years he ceased operation on account of the Government demanding payment of duty upon all spirit manufactured in the colony, at the same rate as if it had been imported. 
Primrose then turned his attention to brewing, and in 1841 founded the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, which he carried on until a few years before his death, transferring the management to his nephew William Ross Sawers (c. 1839–1911) and Arthur Rait Malcom (c. 1847–1890), his son-in-law.

His remains were interred in the West Terrace Cemetery.

173,Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System,174,prolaps,16,"Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System

The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantifications System (POP-Q), is a system of assessing the degree of prolapse of pelvic organs to help standardize diagnosing, comparing, documenting, and sharing of clinical findings. This assessment is used the most frequently. In the UK urologists can specialize in in female urology, The Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System is used as the second most used system. More research publications related to pelvic organ prolapse use the POP-Q as the measure of pelvic organ prolapse.

Pelvic organ prolapse, when assessed using the POP-Q, identifies the prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse to be up to 50% while diagnosis by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6 %. Some advocate that the system of assessment be modified.

The POP-Q was developed in 1996 and it quantifies the descent of pelvic organs into the vagina. The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise distance measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV; which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantifies the movement of other structures into the vaginal lumen and their descent.

The POP-Q assessment tool measures nine points in the vagina. The hymen is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed by the woman while in the dorsal lithotomy position. The anatomical landmarks used are anterior vaginal wall, cervix, hymen, perineal body, total vaginal length, posterior vaginal wall and posterior fornix. A three by three centimeter grid is used to record the proximal and distal numbers. The information on the grid is translated to the appropriate stage of prolapse.

The evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse includes other diagnostic tests in addition to the POP-Q. These can be:
In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse. Examples of pelvic organ prolapse are cystocele, rectocele, urethrocele, enterocele and sigmoidocele. Cystocele is the most common. This system of assessing pelvic organ prolapse is currently used widely in China and the US.

Other assessment tools are used to determine the impact of pelvic floor prolapse. These are Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ),The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the shorter forms PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20.",pelvic organ prolaps quantif pelvic organ prolaps quantif pop assess degre prolaps pelvic organ standard diagnos compar document share clinic findings. assess frequently. uk urologist special femal urolog baden walker halfway score system. public pelvic organ prolaps pop measur pelvic organ prolapse. pelvic organ prolaps assess pop identifi preval pelvic organ prolaps 50 diagnosi symptom preval 3 6 . advoc assess modified. pop develop 1996 quantifi descent pelvic organ vagina. pop reliabl descript support anterior posterior apic vagin wall. object precis distanc measur refer point hymen. cystocel prolaps vagina stag pop criterion rang good support descent vagina report pop stage 0 pop score iv; includ prolaps hymen. quantifi movement structur vagin lumen descent. pop assess tool measur point vagina. hymen refer point point compared. prolaps organ measur centimet hymen. measur valsalva maneuv perform woman dorsal lithotomi position. th anatom landmark anterior vagin wall cervix hymen perin bodi total vagin length posterior vagin wall posterior fornix. centimet grid record proxim distal numbers. grid translat stage prolapse. evalu pelvic organ prolaps includ diagnost test addit pop q. great 200 000 surgeri perform year pelvic organ prolapse. exampl pelvic organ prolaps cystocel rectocel urethrocel enterocel sigmoidocele. cystocel common. assess pelvic organ prolaps china us. assess tool determin impact pelvic floor prolapse. pelvic floor impact questionnair pfiq pelvic floor distress inventori pfdi shorter form pfiq 7 pfdi 20.

176,Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy s Farm in Pine Island Minnesota,177,poem,10,"Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota

""Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota"" is a poem by American poet James Wright. It is one of his best known poems, partially because of the tonal contrast between the content of the poem and its final line.

The poem was first published in ""The Paris Review"". It was later featured in a short story by Ann Beattie also published in ""The Paris Review"". The poem was included in Wright's collection ""This Branch Will Not Break"".

The poem is a description of a pastoral scene from the perspective of a person in a hammock. 

Much of the critical attention focused on the poem has concerned the last line. Dan Piepenbring, writing for ""The Paris Review"", summarized the criticism in a 2010 article:

Since [the poem's publication], that last line has inspired reams of analysis and debate—is it a lament? Is it a joke, a kind of boast? Did Wright intend to undercut or to bolster his pastoral scene with it? Could it be a winking response to Rilke, whose “Archaic Torso of Apollo” concludes with the imperative “You must change your life”?

Thom Gunn, in 1964, dismissed the line as ""...certainly meaningless. The more one searches for an explicit meaning in it, the vaguer it becomes. Other general statements of different import could well be substituted for it and the poem would neither gain nor lose strength."" Robert Bly, a friend of Wright, wrote in defense of the line a year later, and criticized Gunn for being unable to relate to the emotion expressed by the line.

David Mitchell has said that the line is a happy one, writing: ""...I hear him exhale it with a wry laugh"".

The line is discussed in Ann Beattie's short story ""Yancey"".

Wright acknowledged that he was influenced by Chinese poetry in writing ""Lying in a Hammock..."" in an interview with Dave Smith. This influence has been discussed by academics including Sven Birkerts.

The poem has been widely anthologized.

The labellum is greenish or pinkish, egg-shaped, about long and wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle. There is a shiny green or brown, deeply channelled callus along the centre of the labellum, extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November.

""Prasophyllum subbisectum"" was first formally described in 1936 by William Henry Nicholls and the description was published in ""The Victorian Naturalist"" from a specimen collected near Pomonal. The specific epithet (""subbisectum"") is derived from the Latin word ""sectus"" meaning ""cut"", with the prefixes ""sub-"" meaning ""somewhat"" and ""bi-"" meaning ""two"" or ""double"".

The Pomonal leek orchid mostly grows in heathy woodland near Stawell.

In 2010, ""P. subbisectum"" was recorded in four populations with a total of about 130 plants. It is listed as ""Endangered"" under the Commonwealth Government ""Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999"" (EPBC) Act and the Victorian ""Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988"".

Kaat Tilley (20 September 1959-22 June 2012) was a Belgian Flemish fashion designer known for her imaginative and devouring creations.

Kaat Tilley grew up in Kapelle-op-den-Bos and as a child, she was fond of fairy tales. The inaccessibility, strength, beauty and fragility of the fairy-tale figure Snow White became her trademark. Tilley would regularly refer to this in her later visual work.

Tilley studied at Sint Lucas in Brussels and learned the technique of painting there. Tilley was a former student of the Antwerp Fashion Academy. She graduated there cum laude with the theme for her final collection ""Mahler and Venice "".

Tilley was known for her romantic to fairytale clothing. In 1990 she designed a jewelery collection. In 1993 she signed the costumes for the film "" Antoine "". Her creations are midway between fashion and art. She dressed among others Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Naomi Campbell, Melanie Griffith and Halle Berry.

In the meantime she became an established name, witness her retrospective exhibition at the Gaasbeek Castle in the autumn of 2005.

In 2007 Tilley kept on her living and working area in Asbeek (Asse) an exhibition and sale of a large part of her prototypes and paintings. She claimed that she was first a painter and secondly a fashion designer. Art and beauty were inextricably linked throughout her career.

She had a gallery in the Royal Gallery of the Brussels Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert. She designed costumes for Zap Mama and Madredeus. On a commercial level, she struggled with a few setbacks. After a bankruptcy in 2009 she returned two years later with a collection furniture, fabrics, lighting, jewelery and pictorial work. She designed the clothes for the opera La Traviata. The last ten years of her life she lived and worked in a converted watermill in Asbeek.

The designer overcame in 1989 a form of cancer. She died unexpectedly on 22 June 2012 pneumonia by pneumococcus. She is survived by two daughters. The months before her death she had a lot of projects in the pipeline. For example, she designed the uniforms for the cabin crew of Thomas Cook Airlines Belgium and there was the collection for the clothing chain JBC. For the fall of 2012 she was working on the costume design of the musical Peter Pan. Preparations for the sale of its archive at the end of June 2012 were in full swing.

Fritz Lustig (1919–2017) was a German-Jewish emigrant to England during the Nazi era.

Lustig was born on 31 March 1919. he arrived in the United Kingdom in April 1939 (his parents later left Germany for Portugal; his brother, Ted, to the United States, for whom he fought during the war).

He was briefly interned as an ""enemy alien"", at Peveril Camp, on the Isle of Man, in 1940, following the outbreak of World War II. He then enlisted in the British Army's Pioneer Corps, playing cello in its orchestra, but was transferred to the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre in 1943, where he eavesdropped on captured Axis officers at Latimer House and Wilton Park in Buckinghamshire, known then as ""No 1 Distribution Centre"" and ""No 2 Distribution Centre"" respectively.

After rising to Regimental Sergeant Major, he was demobbed in June 1946. He subsequently worked in accountancy and credit control. He obtained British nationality in May 1947.

While working for CSDIC he met Susan Cohn, also a refugee from Germany. They were married in 1945. She died in 2013. One of their two sons is the broadcaster Robin Lustig. The other is Stephen, a music publisher.

193,Starry Internet,194,starri,14,"Starry Internet

Starry Internet is a fixed wireless broadband Internet service provider (ISP or WISP) operated by Starry, Inc., using millimeter-band LMDS connections, sometimes categorized as 5G fixed wireless, to connect its base stations to customer buildings.

Starry, Inc. was publicly announced in January 2016 by Chaitanya ""Chet"" Kanojia, who had previously founded Aereo. , it is providing commercial service to a limited number of apartment buildings in the Boston area for $50/month per apartment, promising 200Mbit/s upload and download speeds. , Starry was based in Boston, had about 100 employees, and had raised $63 million of funding. Kanojia claims that Starry's capital cost will be only $25 per home, as compared to $2,500 for cable.

Starry's system operates on the 38.2 GHz and 38.6 GHz bands, connecting its base stations (""Starry Beam"") to receivers on individual buildings (""Starry Points""). Each base station covers a radius of 1.5 km. Signal propagation is near line-of-sight, not penetrating buildings and windows, and is degraded by foliage or rain, so Starry directs its signal using Multi-user MIMO phased array antennas, and can take advantage of reflections. 

The base station redistributes its signal within a building using Starry's own Wi-Fi router (""Starry Station"").

Analysts are mixed about Starry's prospects. Some point to the failure of Clearwire (which operated WiMax on the 2.5 GHz band), or to technical challenges: ""The physics are tough to overcome, and technology has been slow to improve here."" Others note that if the expected low fixed costs per user are achieved, ""they could profitably offer competitive broadband speeds for a fraction of the current price of wired broadband"".

In January 2018, Starry announced they would be rolling out a beta version of their internet service in Los Angeles and Washington, DC later in the month.

194,Cyrtoctenus,195,cyrtoctenu,9,"Cyrtoctenus

Cyrtoctenus is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid classified within the family Hibbertopteridae. The genus contains six species, ranging in temporal range from the Devonian to the Carboniferous.

""Cyrtoctenus wittebergensis"" is one of the few eurypterids known from the southern hemisphere, where eurypterid finds are rare and usually fragmentary.

""Cyrtoctenus"" was a gigantic Hibbertopterid eurypterid, with ""C. wittebergensis"" reaching lengths of around 1.5 meters. The anterior movable spines of the distal podomeres on the second, third and fourth prosomal appendages were modified to form ""fingers"" associated with fixed combs developed as modifications of the posterior spine.

""Cyrtoctenus"" had further adaptations towards sweep-feeding than other hibbertopterids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that ""Cyrtoctenus"" would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.

It is believed that some of the genera within the Hibbertopteridae represent synonyms of each other. Four of the genera in the family, ""Campylocephalus"", ""Hastimima, Dunsopterus"" and ""Vernonopterus"" are clearly hibbertopterids but known from very incomplete specimens. Further discoveries may point to that some of them are synonymous with either ""Hibbertopterus"" or ""Cyrtoctenus"".

Furthermore, ""Cyrtoctenus"" and ""Hibbertopterus"" might represent different ontogenetic stages of each other, where rachis would have developed in the later moult stages. This would also explain why smaller ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens are more complete than the fragmentary remains known of ""Cyrtoctenus"", as the majority of ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens would represent exuviae whilst ""Cyrtoctenus"" specimens represent actual mortalities susceptible to scavengers.

Anna Maria Dawbin née Anna Maria Hadden (24 November 1816 – 22 November 1905) was a British Australian diarist.

Dawbin was born in Exeter in 1816 to Elizabeth and William Frederick Hadden. Her father was an army officer.

In 1834 she sailed for Van Diemen's Land as the new wife of Andrew Baxter who was in charge of transported convicts. It was on 24 September 1834 that she started her first of 32 diaries that are extant, although it is clear that she had always kept a diary up to that point. She arrived aboard the ""Augusta Jessie"" and she and Andrew lived in Hobart Town and Launceston. Her husband was an officer in the 50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot and she established herself in Australian society. Her diary records that she was very ""friendly"" with Richard Dry who was to be Premier of Tasmania.

In 1839 Anna and Andrew decided to become squatters in New South Wales. Andrew had sold his commission and they hoped to retire on their success but by 1845 they were moving to a new location and the marriage was no longer happy. In 1849 she left her husband to care for her niece and nephew in Hobart after their mother died. She became their carer and returned with them to England. her brother remarried and no longer needed her as foster mother in England. She had no purpose until she heard that her husband had become rich and he had committed suicide.

She returned to Australia in 1857 and met a young man named Richard Dawbin on board. They married on 1 September after she had sold what had been her husband's property. They bought a cattle station and Anna recorded her husband's failings. They were bankrupt by 1861 and she was left in Australia whilst her husband returned to England. She had male friends until 5 April 1865 when she sailed back on the ""Nimrod"". She was reunited with her husband in Somerset. Her diary goes blank for a while. They returned to Australia where Dawbin failed to manage a salmon breeding station.

She published her earlier diaries as ""Memories of the Past"" in 1876 anonymously. However it is noted that these are edited decades later and lack the immediacy of the contemporary diaries.

Dawbin died in Melbourne in 1905. The 845,000 words that survived from her dairies were published as her diary in 1992.",anna dawbin anna maria dawbin née anna maria hadden 24 novemb 1816 22 novemb 1905 british australian diarist. dawbin born exet 1816 elizabeth william frederick hadden. father armi officer. 1834 sail van diemen land wife andrew baxter charg transport convicts. 24 septemb 1834 start 32 diari extant clear diari point. arriv aboard augusta jessi andrew live hobart town launceston. husband offic 50th queen regiment foot establish australian society. diari record friendli richard dri premier tasmania. 1839 anna andrew decid squatter south wales. andrew sell commiss hop retir success 1845 move locat marriag longer happy. 1849 left husband care niec nephew hobart mother died. carer return england. brother remarri longer need foster mother england. purpos heard husband rich commit suicide. return australia 1857 met young man name richard dawbin board. marri 1 septemb sell husband property. bought cattl station anna record husband failings. bankrupt 1861 left australia husband return england. male friend 5 april 1865 sail nimrod . reunit husband somerset. diari blank while. return australia dawbin fail manag salmon breed station. publish earlier diari memori 1876 anonymously. edit decad lack immediaci contemporari diaries. dawbin die melbourn 1905. 845 000 surviv dairi publish diari 1992.

Fort Juelson, designated 21OT198 in the state archaeological inventory, is a historic site located east of Underwood, Minnesota, United States. An earthen fort was built at this hilltop in July 1876 after rumors of Indian attacks in Foxhome, French, and Fergus Falls following the Battle of Little Bighorn in Montana. Many settlers left the area. Charles A. Dollner, a local merchant, suggested the rest of the people band together and build the fortification under leadership of two American Civil War veterans, Hans Juelson and Berge O. Lee. The scare proved to be a hoax, and the fort was never used for defensive purposes. Remnants of the sod barricade are still on the site. 

It was discovered that the fort was built on the site of a Woodland period burial mound group, which is also a part of this historic designation. It is made up of four small elliptical and linear burial mounds. Two of the mounds were located inside the fort, one was along the western wall of the fort, and one is located west of the fort.

He was an Irish Protestant raised partly on his father's estates in County Wexford. His father Solomon Richards had served in the New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell.

In 1689 he oversaw the artillery bombardment during the Siege of Carrickfergus, where he was wounded three times. He was apparently present at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690 and at the decisive Siege of Limerick the next year.

In 1692 following the Treaty of Limerick which ended the Irish War, much of his force was redeployed to Flanders where William was leading an Allied Army against the French. His sons Jacob and Michael both oversaw the Artillery during the Battles of Steenkirk and Landen and went some way to establishing the traditions of the Royal Artillery.

He had three sons, all of whom pursued military careers. The eldest, also called Jacob, served as part of the Tangier Garrison and later with William of Orange in Flanders. He died in 1701. The second son John Richards converted to Catholicism. This led him to serve abroad in the Austrian Army. In 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession he was commissioned into the Portuguese Army allied to Britain. He was killed at the Siege of Alicante in 1709.

After completing his doctorate from the University of Missouri, Hammond served as Assistant to the Southern Illinois University Carbondale Chancellor from 1970 to 1972 when he was promoted to Assistant Dean of Students. He served that position for a year. Following his stint at Southern Illinois, Hammond became Seton Hall University's student affairs vice president, a position he held from 1973 to 1976. On July 1, 1976, Hammond was named the University of Louisville's first Student Affairs vice president.

As the first student affairs vice president, Hammond was tasked with creating the student affairs division for the university. During his ten years there, Hammond created departments as well as hired staff to oversee already created departments such as Greek Life. Hammond left for Fort Hays State University in March 1987.

On March 1, 1987, Hammond began his nearly 28-year career as president of Fort Hays State University. During his time at Fort Hays State, Hammond created relationships with the Western Kansas community colleges, expanded the university with additions of new buildings, wind turbines and created the university's first online college system for distance education in 1997. Hammond also built a relationship with SIAS International University in China, establishing a bachelor's program there and making Fort Hays State the first university in the United States to be approved by the Chinese Ministry of Education. Hammond also increased the university's enrollment by 9,000 students over the course of 27 years.

On the athletics side, Hammond helped the university athletic programs transition from the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II, completing the move in 1991. Fifteen years later, Hammond also helped move the university from the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference to the university's current conference, the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association in 2006. Hammond was also instrumental in creating the softball program in 1999, and both men's and women's soccer in 2011.

The packaging noted that it includes 67 albums that have been remastered, several of which were being made available on CD for the first time. Two of those, ""I Love My Lady"" and ""The Island"", were debuting in their entirety for the first time anywhere, and 38 of the bonus tracks included had also previously gone unreleased. 

In his review of the box set for The Second Disc, Joe Marchese asserted, ""What it reveals is that the history of Johnny Mathis is, put simply, the history of American music in the second half of the twentieth century."" In summation he wrote, ""Since Johnny Mathis's recording debut, virtually everything has changed about the sound of music, not to mention the music industry. But Mathis has held steadfast to his core values as an artist, and as a 'singer's singer,' as he’s happily traversed from genre to genre. That consistence of quality and variation of style makes the immersive journey contained in ""The Voice of Romance: The Columbia Original Album Collection"" one well worth taking for any fan or collector of American popular song. Basking in the glow of this nostalgic trip, you just might get misty yourself.""

242,Fighting Cocks railway station,243,station,13,"Fighting Cocks railway station

Fighting Cocks railway station was a railway station on the original course of the Stockton & Darlington Railway (S&DR) which served the villages of Middleton St George and Low Dinsdale in Darlington, part of the Ceremonial County of Durham, as well the once popular Dinsdale Spa Hotel from 1829.

When the Stockton & Darlington Railway first opened on 10 October 1825, there were no official stations as passenger trains were provided by independent coach operators who purchased a licence to the railway company to enable them to operate on the line. Tickets were therefore sold by local publicans and so it has been claimed that the Fighting Cocks public house, a coaching inn located adjacent to where the railway crossed Rykeneild Street, could be the oldest station booking office in the World. It was not until the success of passenger services on the Liverpool & Manchester Railway persuaded the S&DR to purchase the coach operators and in December 1833 it began to operate its own locomotive-hauled passenger service.

In 1829, the Dinsdale Spa Hotel was opened close to the village of Low Dinsdale which led to an increase in travel to the village using the railway. As a result a permanent station was opened during the 1830s (appearing in timetables by 1838), on the east side of the level crossing, to cater for this traffic. It was originally called 'Middleton and Dinsdale' but was renamed 'Fighting Cocks' in 1866.

In 1863 the S&DR was amalgamated into the North Eastern Railway (NER) who, on 1 July 1887 opened a new line from south of Darlington Bank Top station to Oak Tree Junction, east of Fighting Cocks station, to enable passenger services on the ex-S&DR route to serve Bank Top station. However the opening of this new route meant that Fighting Cocks was bypassed and so a new station was provided at to replace it. Over the course of its life as a passenger station, approximately 30,000 passenger tickets were sold to Fighting Cocks. From this point on Fighting Cocks was only served by goods trains until it was closed completely as an economy measure in 1964.

The line through the station remained as a through line until it was severed as the western end on 21 May 1967 though it was partially retained as a short branch line from Oak Tree Junction until the 1970s.

245,Sculpture in Mexico,246,sculptur,10,"Sculpture in Mexico

Sculpture is one of the oldest arts in Mexico. In Prehispanic Mexico, it is present in pyramids, sanctuaries, esplanades and communal objects; examples of this are the Olmec, Mayan, Teotihuacan, Tarascan, Mixtec and Aztec sculptures.

Many of these sculptures have been cataloged as masterpieces and stand out for their monumentality, since many of them are huge and exposed to be seen publicly.

Sculpture after the conquest is divided into two areas: decorative and statuary. Both were made in stone or wood. Plateresque art was essentially sculptural and in the Colony it produced important altarpieces. 

In the cathedral of Mexico, work Claudio Arciniega and Juan Miguel Agüero. It will become the paradigm of colonial architecture. Francisco Becerra will raise the cathedral of Puebla. Francisco Antonio Guerrero y Torres: Chapel of the Pocito, in the Villa de Guadalupe. In Puebla, a very active baroque school appears. Sanctuaries of Ocotlán in Tlaxcala, and of San Francisco de Acatepec, two magnificent examples of the Novohispano Baroque.

In all the colonial cities, fine finishes in the ornamentation and the facades of the churches can be appreciated. Oaxaca and its numerous temples like Soledad and Santo Domingo show the beauty and magnificence of it.

The academies created in Europe from the s17th century were founded on the rational abandoning the purely religious vision that had dominated the previous centuries. In New Spain, this philosophy sparked a reaction against the baroque. Thus, altarpieces that were essentially sculptural were considered overloaded and replaced by architectural manifestations. The central figure of this era in New Spain is the Spaniard Manuel Tolsá.

Romanticism tended to break the norms and strict models of classicism, as it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. Religious sculpture was reduced to sporadic imagery, while secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature.1

Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the insurgency movement and scenes and characters of pre-Cortesian history, and portraits of the old aristocracy, of the rising bourgeoisie and champions of the pre revolution. The transcendent sphere consisted in introducing civil reasons, the first national types and glimpses of a current of self expression.

Differentiated by its objectives and the emphasis of its theme, three currents emerged: an indigenist, archaic and folkloric; another, neoclassical, civic and historical; and a third, socialist, with ideological propaganda.

During the 20th century, great exponents of Mexican sculpture are Rómulo Rozo, Enrique Gottdiener Soto, Juan Soriano, José Luis Cuevas, Sebastián and Mathias Goeritz.",sculptur mexico sculptur old art mexico. prehispan mexico pyramid sanctuari esplanad commun objects; exampl olmec mayan teotihuacan tarascan mixtec aztec sculptures. sculptur catalog masterpiec stand monument huge expos publicly. sculptur conquest divid area decor statuary. stone wood. plateresqu art essenti sculptur coloni produc altarpieces. cathedr mexico work claudio arciniega juan miguel agüero. paradigm coloni architecture. francisco becerra rais cathedr puebla. francisco antonio guerrero torr chapel pocito villa guadalupe. puebla activ baroqu school appears. sanctuari ocotlán tlaxcala san francisco acatepec magnific exampl novohispano baroque. coloni citi fine finish ornament facad church appreciated. oaxaca numer templ soledad santo domingo beauti magnific it. academi creat europ s17th centuri found ration abandon pure religi vision domin previou centuries. spain philosophi spark reaction baroque. altarpiec essenti sculptur consid overload replac architectur manifestations. central figur era spain spaniard manuel tolsá. romantic tend break norm strict model classic pursu idea influenc realism nationalism. religi sculptur reduc sporad imageri secular sculptur continu portrait monument art civic nature.1 1820 1880 predomin theme success religi imag biblic scene allegori symbol insurg movement scene charact pre cortesian histori portrait aristocraci rise bourgeoisi champion pre revolution. transcend sphere consist introduc civil reason nation type glimps current expression. differenti object emphasi theme current emerg indigenist archaic folkloric; neoclass civic historical; socialist ideolog propaganda. 20th centuri great expon mexican sculptur rómulo rozo enriqu gottdien soto juan soriano josé lui cueva sebastián mathia goeritz.

BambooHR is an American technology company that provides human resources software as a service. Founded in 2008 by Ben Peterson and Ryan Sanders, the company is based in Lindon, Utah.

BambooHR has an ""anti-workaholic policy"" in which management prohibits employees from working more than 40 hours in a week and fired one employee for violating their policy by working too much.

BambooHR's services include an applicant tracking system and an employee benefits tracker. Juan Martinez and Rob Marvin wrote in ""PC Magazine"" in 2017 that although the website is ""easy to get up and running"", it is more expensive than a large number of its competitors and its website is ""pretty but lacks functionality"".

BambooHR was founded in 2008 by Ben Peterson and Ryan Sanders. Based in Lindon, Utah, the company has a dancing panda mascot. BambooHR had 200 employees in September 2016. In 2016, BambooHR served 5,000 clients that were based in 100 countries. BambooHR customers in 2017 included Shopify, Foursquare, and Reddit.

Most of BambooHR's employees are salaried employees and do not qualify for overtime. BambooHR has an ""anti-workaholic policy"" in which employees are forbidden from laboring over a 40-hour week. Company co-founder Ryan Sanders' rationale was that occupational burnout has a detrimental effect on the health of his employees and negatively affects their families and his company. He started taking this view during his organizational leadership studies as a graduate student at Gonzaga University.

BambooHR started a ""paid paid vacation"" policy in 2015. Employees who have worked at BambooHR for at least six months are eligible for $2,000 in reimbursements for vacation expenses like airline tickets, hotel rooms, and other tourist activities. Joe Fryer profiled BambooHR's vacation policy on the ""Today"" show on September 16, 2016. According to a 2015 article in ""The Wall Street Journal"", BambooHR terminated an employee for violating their workweek policy by working more than 40 hours.

BambooHR provides companies a human capital management software as a service. The service has a dashboard homepage with different sections for employee information, vacation time recordkeeping, and reports. The sections are: ""My Info"", ""Employees"", ""Job Openings"", ""Reports"", and ""Files"". The dashboard also contains an employee's image, contact details, and vacation time remaining. It has areas that show scheduled lessons and business communications. Users can see their coworkers' birthdays and scheduled time off.

BambooHR's software includes an applicant tracking system. The system has a catalogue of job opportunities and data about each opportunity including the hiring manager, how many people have applied, and how long it has been posted. BambooHR's integration allows job openings to be posted at the same time to the company's jobs page and to career sites like Glassdoor.

BambooHR allows companies to record employee benefits. It includes reports that help employees fill out Affordable Care Act compliance forms. In 2017, Juan Martinez and Rob Marvin wrote in ""PC Magazine"" that BambooHR's benefits administration functionalities are inferior to Zenefits'. It also has a performance review feature. It provides an open API to allow combination with other HR software services. In 2017, it started BambooHR Marketplace to allow software developers to market HR apps they have integrated with BambooHR.

The Bnai Zion Medical Center was established in 1922 as the first Jewish hospital in Haifa, the center offers medical care, education, research and services to the diverse and growing population of northern Israel. In a recent survey in a national newspaper, the Bnai Zion medical center was voted the first hospital in the Haifa region of Israel.

The Bnai Zion medical center is a municipal hospital that provides medical care. Attention is given to rehabilitation services that include: orthopedic, neurological, cardiological, physical and occupational therapy. It is the only hospital in northern Israel with a comprehensive rehabilitation program.

The hospital is in a state of constant alert, and at any moment it is ready to receive the victims of terrorist attacks. In times of national emergency, the entire medical center switches to crisis mode, and at the time of the attack, it receives severely injured victims, who have a critical need for trauma care.

The staff and patients of the Bnai Zion medical center reflect the diversity of the population of northern Israel. Christian and Muslim Arabs, Druze and Jews, doctors and staff work together as a unified team that provides medical care to every patient admitted to the hospital, regardless of their beliefs or ethnicity.

Due to the level of the medical center and the excellence of its service and personnel, the State of Israel has designated it as an official military hospital that meets the medical needs of soldiers in the region. During and after the Second Lebanon War (2006), the hospital has treated civilians and provided rehabilitation services to wounded military men and women.The center is within the range of rocket attacks from Lebanon. Since the emergency room of the hospital is vulnerable, Bnai Zion is raising funds to build a new protected underground unit, which will be fortified against nuclear, biological and chemical attacks.

The Bnai Zion medical center is affiliated with the Ruth & Bruce Rappaport School of Medicine of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology and serves as a teaching hospital for its students. Many of the center's department heads and physicians are on the faculty and are associated with their various medical research initiatives. The hospital also operates one of the oldest nursing schools in Israel, which offers an academic degree.

283,Ma rib Campaign,284,houthi,8,"Ma'rib Campaign

The Ma'rib campaign was a campaign for control of the Ma'rib Governorate of Yemen, between the Houthis and Yemen Army units loyal to Ali Abdullah Saleh on one side, and militiamen and Yemen Army units loyal to Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi on the other side.

In September 2015, Saudi-backed Yemeni forces loyal to the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi engaged Houthi forces and successfully established control over the eastern and western regions of Marib province. They took territory in Sirwah and Hareeb including the Hailan mountain, Al Ateef, Al Makhdarah, and Al Masaryah hill.

Mar'ib is of particular strategic importance in the conflict because it is a center for oil & gas production in Yemen; the powerplants of Mar'ib supply power to a significant part of the country and a gas pipeline passes south through Marib to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. The Safer Exploration and Production Operations Company and other foreign companies who work in the energy sector are based in Mar'ib. 45 Emirati soldiers, 10 Saudis and 5 Bahrainis were killed when a Houthi missile crashed into the coalition base at Safer in September 2015.

The 2015 missile strike marked an escalation in the conflict. In the months that followed, coalition air strikes targeted more civilian sites than military targets. During the 18 month period, between 26 March 2015 and 2 August 2016 there were nearly 500 attacks in Mar'ib, which was located at the frontline of the battle between coalation and Houthi forces. In 2016 the Yemen Data Project reported that Saudi air raids had hit a market in Sirwah twenty-four times.

In October, ""Xinhua"" reported that Houthi forces had killed Major General Abdel Rab al-Shadadi, a high-level pro-government commander. Several prominent Houthis, including militia leaders Hussain al-Mutawakel and Abu Jabar Ahmad al-Houthi, were captured by coalition forces. Coalition forces fought with Houthis for control over the route that runs from Yemen's capital Sanaa through Sirwah to Mar'ib.

US drone strikes were reported in early 2017 after the election of President Donald Trump. This marked the first U.S. engagement in Yemen since the failed Yakla raid. In November 2017 the ""New York Times"" reported that Mar'ib was ""an island of relative calm"".",ma rib campaign ma rib campaign campaign control ma rib governor yemen houthi yemen armi unit loyal ali abdullah saleh militiaman yemen armi unit loyal abdrabbuh mansur hadi side. septemb 2015 saudi back yemeni forc loyal govern abdrabbuh mansur hadi engag houthi forc establish control eastern western region marib province. territori sirwah hareeb includ hailan mountain ateef makhdarah masaryah hill. mar ib strateg conflict center oil ga product yemen; powerpl mar ib suppli power countri ga pipelin pass south marib gulf aden red sea. safer explor product oper compani foreign compani work energi sector base mar ib. 45 emirati soldier 10 saudi 5 bahraini kill houthi missil crash coalit base safer septemb 2015. 2015 missil strike mark escal conflict. month coalit air strike target civilian site militari targets. 18 month period 26 march 2015 2 august 2016 500 attack mar ib locat frontlin battl coalat houthi forces. 2016 yemen data project report saudi air raid hit market sirwah times. octob xinhua report houthi forc kill major gener abdel rab shadadi high level pro govern commander. promin houthi includ militia leader hussain mutawakel abu jabar ahmad houthi captur coalit forces. coalit forc fought houthi control rout run yemen capit sanaa sirwah mar ib. drone strike report earli 2017 elect presid donald trump. mark u.s. engag yemen fail yakla raid. novemb 2017 york time report mar ib island rel calm .
284,Pollia gens,285,pollii,4,"Pollia (gens)

The gens Pollia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. The gens must have been very old, as one of the original Servian tribes was named after it, suggesting that the Pollii were important landowners during the Roman monarchy. However, few Pollii are mentioned in history, and none of them attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state. A number of Pollii are known from inscriptions. 

The nomen ""Pollius"" seems to be a patronymic surname derived from the old praenomen ""Paullus"", ""little"", which was little used in historical times, except in its feminine form, ""Paulla"", or as a cognomen, particularly by the great patrician house of the Aemilii. An alternative derivation would be from the surname ""Pollio"", originally referring to one who polished arms. Chase classifies ""Pollius"" among those gentilicia which either originated at Rome, or are not known to have come from anywhere else.

The Pollii used a variety of praenomina, especially ""Publius"", ""Gaius"", ""Marcus"", ""Gnaeus"", and ""Lucius"", all of which were very common throughout Roman history. Other names appear occasionally, including ""Quintus"" and ""Numerius"", of which the latter was widespread, but uncommon.",pollia gen gen pollia minor plebeian famili ancient rome. gen origin servian tribe name suggest pollii landown roman monarchy. pollii mention histori attain high offic roman state. number pollii inscriptions. nomen polliu patronym surnam deriv praenomen paullu histor time feminin form paulla cognomen great patrician hous aemilii. altern deriv surnam pollio origin refer polish arms. chase classifi polliu gentilicia origin rome else. pollii varieti praenomen publiu gaiu marcu gnaeu luciu common roman history. name occasion includ quintu numeriu widespread uncommon.

Samsara is a single-player, puzzle platform video game in which players guide the protagonist Zee and a ""shadowed echo"" to safety by dropping objects with different forms and behaviours into two mirrored gameplay areas separated by the surface of a pool. ""Samsara"" is due to be released in ""early 2018"" for Microsoft Windows, macOS and Xbox One. The developer, Auckland based Marker Limited, states that versions for iOS and Android will follow shortly afterwards. ""Samsara"" is an original title from Marker, a New Zealand development studio best known for its contract work.

""Samsara"" was on display for the public to play at PAX Australia 2017. It was reported that the puzzles were physics-based, and involved moving the player character from one point to another, in a game world divided into two halves horizontally. The upper world was described as ""real"" with the lower mirrored half described as a ""Stranger Things inspired Upside-Down"". The gameplay video shows the player selecting and rotating blocks from the right-hand side of the play area and dropping them into the gameworld. Blocks respond to gravity, and gravity is reversed in the lower, upside-down segment of the play area.

The game comprises 77 levels across 6 realms. According to the developer Marker, blocks with different properties are introduced later in the game and more complex interaction with the environment, including thorns that wither or grow depending on the game character that passes them. Senior Producer Alex Humphries states that ""the player uses very simple mechanics to solve increasingly intricate problems"", stressing that ""progression has been carefully tuned"".

302,At North Farm,303,poem,10,"At North Farm

""At North Farm"" is a poem by American poet and writer John Ashbery. 

The poem first appeared in ""The New Yorker"" in 1984. It was the opening poem of Ashbery's 1984 collection ""The Wave"". It was written soon after Ashbery almost died due to an infection. 

The poem is in part a reference to the epic poem ""Kalevala"", which Ashbery revisited in his later poem ""Finnish Rhapsody"".

The poem loosely adheres to the form of a sonnet, with the traditional fourteen lines and the octet/seste of a Petrarchan sonnet. Adhering to the format was not intentional on Ashbery's part.

In her review of ""A Wave"", Helen Vendler wrote that the poem deals with the pains of aging using clichés.

The poem is evocative of W. H. Auden's work. Auden had an influence on Ashbery early poetry, an influence that diminished over the course of his career.

Although shorter and simpler than many of his most famous works, it is considered to be a well-known poem of Ashbery's.",north farm north farm poem american poet writer john ashbery. poem appear yorker 1984. open poem ashberi 1984 collect wave . write ashberi die infection. poem refer epic poem kalevala ashberi revisit poem finnish rhapsodi . poem loos adher form sonnet tradit fourteen line octet sest petrarchan sonnet. adher format intent ashberi part. review wave helen vendler write poem deal pain age clichés. poem evoc w. h. auden work. auden influenc ashberi earli poetri influenc diminish career. shorter simpler famou work consid poem ashberi s.

Hell is the fourth studio album by Salem-based doom metal project Hell. It was released on August 11, 2017 as a limited cassette through the label Sentient Ruin Laboratories and as a digital download through Hell's own label, LowerYourHead. ""Hell"" received critical acclaim from the few publications that covered it.

After Hell's trilogy of self-titled albums concluded in 2012 with ""Hell III"", frontman M.S.W. considered discontinuing the project. About the change of heart, he said:

""Hell"" is a doom metal album and, as such, is driven by slow, downtuned guitar riffs. Reviewer Shakeel Cox-Henry noted that the vocal styles on the album are ""very much alien"" to traditional doom metal, describing them as abrasive, tortured, and atonal. Operatic singing is incorporated on the closing track, ""Seelenos"", by Karli Mcnutt. In addition to the unusual vocals, Cox-Henry wrote that the songs are structured unconventionally, lacking predictable progression and varying often in tempo.

Another uncommon feature of ""Hell"" is its use of samples. The album's opening song, ""Helmzmen"", features the Mayday call of a doomed ship that sank in the Gulf of Alaska. The track ""Wandering Soul"" contains a sample that the US military used in a psychological weapon project against the Viet Cong in the Vietnam War. ""Hell's"" final track, ""Seelenos"", contains quotes from the works of Emily Dickinson.

The songs ""SubOdin"" and ""Inscriptus"" first appeared on Hell's 2015 self-titled EP.

""Hell"" received highly positive reviews. Writing for ""Metal Injection"", Cody Davis said, ""[""Hell's""] entirety results in what can only be described as one of the most enthralling albums to come out in 2017 and a strong album of the year candidate."" Shakeel Cox-Henry of ""Midlands Metalheads"" wrote, ""this album is strong, consistent, and most importantly, uses its resources to create an atmosphere of dereliction and suffering that only Hell could create."" ""Hell"" appeared as number 14 on ""Stereogum's"" 2017 year-end best metal albums list; Ian Chainey of that same publication called the album's execution ""top-notch"" and repeatedly praised its riffs.

The name of the game series is reminiscent of the Dutch painter Jan Vermeer. The game title of the original game contained a graphic that is similar to his famous work ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". In the game, however, the name stands for a fictional art forger named Vico Vermeer.

The action takes place in the 1920s. The game is playable in both single and multiplayer modes with up to 4 players (up to 5 in Vermeer 2). The aim of the game is to recover works of art which were lost in the first world war and which belong the players' dying uncle - the Berlin art collector Walter von Grünschild. Each player receives funding from the uncle which has to be increased by various means in order to enable the player to buy at auction various works of art as they come up for sale. The winner will inherit Walter von Grünschild's fortune and gain control of the corporate empire.

As the main source of income, the player engages in the acquisition of and trade in colonial goods. To this end, property is being acquired all over the world with up to twenty-four plantations for the cultivation of coffee, cocoa, silk, tea or tobacco. The harvested goods are then being sold at major trading venues in London and New York. Commodity forward transactions with individual customers are also possible. In addition, revenue can be generated through stock and foreign exchange trading and it is possible to win money at the racecourse.

With the assets generated, a total of 40 paintings belonging to the uncle's former collection can be acquired at auction. If a player does not have sufficient knowledge of art, he can easily end up with a counterfeit. Numerous deceptively genuine reproductions of the art forger Vico Vermeer are in circulation. In order to generate a game score, only real works or art are counted. Images of the forger Vico Vermeer are accepted by the uncle, as long as none of the other players can present the corresponding original. In order conceal the pictures players are chasing, players can choose to be represented by intermediaries at auction.

The global economic crisis and many other unforeseen events are troubling the players or offering opportunities and bringing him luck. Numerous gimmicks lighten up the game.

326,Jean Philippe Aviance,327,avianc,26,"Jean-Philippe Aviance

Jean-Philippe Aviance is a French American house and techno DJ and producer from Washington, D.C. His career took off in 1990 when he started DJing for Mother Juan Aviance's voguing house (the House of Aviance) and weekly ""Kindergarten Parties"" at the Vault Nightclub in D.C. These weekly parties were frequented by U.S. nightlife personalities like Kevin Aviance (whom Jean-Philippe had worked with before back in the 1980s), New York City's Club kids such as Amanda Lepore, James St. James and Kenny Kenny. Jean-Philippe was the House of Aviance's first ever DJ. The House of Aviance is one of the legendary houses within the ball scene known for its vogueing, fashion, music and performances. Jean-Philippe is a member of that House, and it is from that House where he takes his last name.

In 1991, Aviance produced a track titled ""Go Bitch Go! – ""Work This Pussy"""" (Original Bitch Mix). This track has been covered and released numerous times by some high-profile DJs such as Armand Van Helden in his 2014 ""Masterpiece"". According to music critic Barry Walters, Britney Spears' 2013 track ""Work Bitch"" from her ""Britney Jean"" album is a recreation of """"the vogueing vibe of gay/trans bitch tracks like Go Bitch Go's ""(Work This) Pussy"""" [Go Bitch Go! – ""Work This Pussy""] originally produced by Aviance in 1991. Critic Christina Lee posits that, Britney's ""Work Bitch"" track sounds more like RuPaul's 1993 track ""Supermodel (You Better Work)"". Aviance would go on to produce other classic house tracks such as ""Giv Me Luv"" - which was remixed in 2009 by DJs Chris Cox and Yiannis Mistress.
Other works include ""Ultraworld – Life After Death on Strictly Rhythm"" (1991), ""Sexy Thing"" (1996) ""Useless"" (1999) and ""Black On Black"" (2001).

Throughout his career, Aviance has gone by several variations of his name including J. P. Aviance, J. P. Wilkerson, J. Philippe, J. Phillipe (Alcatraz), J. Phillippe, J. Phillippe Aviance, J.P., J.P. Aviance, J.Phillipe, Jean - Philippe, Jean Philip Aviance, Jean Philipe Aviance, Jean Philippe, Jean Philippe Aviance, Jean Philippe-Aviance, Jean Phillipe, Jean Phillipe Aviance, Jean Phillippe, Jean Phillippe Aviance, Jean-Philippe, Jean-Philippe Aviance, Jean-Philippe Avians, Jean-Phillipe, Jean-Phillippe, JP, and JP Avience.

Aviance was member of Alcatraz along with fellow U.S. producer/mixer Victor Imbres whom he collaborated with on ""Giv Me Luv"" (1995) - which reached number 12 in the UK Charts (1996).

Alcatraz was a duo consisting of Aviance and Imbres. The duo's debut single was ""Give Me Luv"" — which was released on Deep Dish's Yoshitoshi label in early 1995. This track was Aviance and Imbres' first collaboration. They had ""first met when Imbres was engineering a remix of Deep Dish's ""Satori"" by Aviance."" Alcatraz was not envisaged as a permanent collaboration. However, Aviance and Imbres' collaboration gained them journalistic and club support until the two parted company.

388,1958 Mailuu Suu tailings dam failure,389,mailuu suu,9,"1958 Mailuu-Suu tailings dam failure

The 1958 Mailuu-Suu tailings dam failure in the industrial town of Mailuu-Suu, (Kyrgyz: Майлуусуу), Jalal-Abad Region, southern Kyrgyzstan, caused the uncontrolled release of of radioactive waste. 

The event caused a number of direct casualties and widespread environmental damage. It was the single worst incident in a region of arid, mountainous western Kyrgyzstan, with a collection of shuttered Soviet-era uranium mining and processing sites, a legacy of extensive radioactive waste dumps, and a history of flooding and mudslides.

As of 2017, despite recent remediations funded by the World Bank and others, the treatment of radioactive waste at Mailuu-Suu still poses serious health and safety risks for local residents. 

Oil was discovered here in the early 1900s. Deposits of radium-bearing barites had been discovered by Alexander Fersman in 1929, during his national mineralogical resources survey for the new Soviet government. Uranium mining began in 1946, organized by the ""Zapadnyi Mining and Chemical Combine"". In addition to mining, two uranium plants would process more than of uranium ore, by ion exchange and alkaline leach, to produce uranium oxide for Soviet atomic bomb projects. The processed ore was both mined locally and imported from elsewhere in the Eastern bloc. 

The town was classified as one of the Soviet government's secret cities, officially known only as ""Mailbox 200"".

Uranium mining was halted in 1968. Operations left behind some 23 separate uranium tailings dams and 13 waste rock dumps, poorly designed on unstable hillsides above a town of 20,000 people in an area prone to both landslides and earthquakes, holding a total of material containing radionuclides and heavy metals. No attempt to stabilize or seal the material was done when Soviet mining ceased. 

On April 16, 1958, with mining and processing plants still operational, a combination of poor design, neglect, heavy rainfall and a reported earthquake caused the #7 tailings dam at Mailuu-Suu to fail. About 50% of the entire volume of the dam flowed into the swift Mailuu-Suu River, only downhill from the breach. The waste then spread about downstream across the national border into Uzbekistan then into the heavily populated Fergana Valley. The Mailuu-Suu River is a tributary of the Kara Darya, used for agricultural irrigation in the valley. 

Some fatalities, building destruction, and contamination of the flood plain were reported as the direct result of the mudflow. Lack of any public response by officials makes it difficult to identify fatalities from the April 1958 event, especially as distinguished from everyday exposure. 

Longterm health effects are more measurable. Grave threats to long-term residents persist, with residents experiencing far higher rates of cancer, goiter, anemia, and other illnesses related to radiological exposure.

Mailuu-Suu was found to be one of the 10 most polluted sites in the world in a study published in 2006 by the Blacksmith Institute.

Annual spring flooding and the lack of maintenance pose a continued threat of further releases of radioactive material. In 1994, a new landslide temporarily dammed the Mailuu-Suu River. In 2002 a flood caused by a mudslide nearly submerged a tailings pit. 

The World Bank approved a US$5 million grant to reclaim the tailings pits in 2004, and approved an additional $1 million grant for the project in 2011. The United Nations Development Programme, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have also funded programs.",1958 mailuu suu tail dam failur 1958 mailuu suu tail dam failur industri town mailuu suu kyrgyz майлуусуу jalal abad region southern kyrgyzstan caus uncontrol releas radioact waste. event caus number direct casualti widespread environment damage. singl bad incid region arid mountain western kyrgyzstan collect shutter soviet era uranium mine process site legaci extens radioact wast dump histori flood mudslides. 2017 remedi fund bank treatment radioact wast mailuu suu pose health safeti risk local residents. oil discov earli 1900s. deposit radium bear barit discov alexand fersman 1929 nation mineralog resourc survey soviet government. uranium mine begin 1946 organ zapadnyi mine chemic combin . addit mine uranium plant process uranium ore ion exchang alkalin leach produc uranium oxid soviet atom bomb projects. process ore mine local import eastern bloc. town classifi soviet govern secret citi offici mailbox 200 . uranium mine halt 1968. oper left 23 separ uranium tail dam 13 wast rock dump design unstabl hillsid town 20 000 peopl area prone landslid earthquak hold total materi radionuclid heavi metals. attempt stabil seal materi soviet mine ceased. april 16 1958 mine process plant oper combin poor design neglect heavi rainfal report earthquak caus 7 tail dam mailuu suu fail. 50 entir volum dam flow swift mailuu suu river downhil breach. wast spread downstream nation border uzbekistan heavili popul fergana valley. mailuu suu river tributari kara darya agricultur irrig valley. fatal build destruct contamin flood plain report direct result mudflow. lack public respons offici difficult identifi fatal april 1958 event distinguish everyday exposure. longterm health effect measurable. grave threat long term resid persist resid experi high rate cancer goiter anemia ill radiolog exposure. mailuu suu 10 pollut site studi publish 2006 blacksmith institute. annual spring flood lack mainten pose continu threat releas radioact material. 1994 landslid temporarili dam mailuu suu river. 2002 flood caus mudslid submerg tail pit. bank approv 5 grant reclaim tail pit 2004 approv addit 1 grant project 2011. unit nation develop programm european bank reconstruct develop fund programs.

416,Alice Acheson,417,acheson,8,"Alice Acheson

Alice Stanley Acheson (August 12, 1895 – January 20, 1996) was an American painter and printmaker.

Born in Charlevoix, Michigan, Acheson was the daughter of artist Jane C. Stanley and granddaughter of John Mix Stanley; her father Louis was a railroad lawyer. She grew up in Detroit. She majored in art at Wellesley College, where among her classmates was the sister of Dean Acheson, who introduced the couple; the two married in May 1917, the same month in which she graduated from college. She continued her artistic studies both before and after moving to Washington, D.C. with her husband, taking lessons at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Corcoran School of Art, and the school at the Phillips Collection. From 1919 she was active in as an artist in Washington, eventually joining and exhibiting with the Society of Washington Artists, from which she received an honorable mention in 1940; she was also an active member of the Washington Water Color Club, the Artists Guild of Washington, and the National Association of Women Artists. For the duration of World War II she abandoned painting to pursue agriculture in support of the war effort, also teaching painting and drawing to wounded servicemen at the Forest Glen annex of Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She took it up again when her husband was appointed United States Secretary of State, but she refused to exhibit until he returned to private life, feeling she would be using his fame to further her own career. Acheson was described as a fashionable woman who, though she took scant interest in foreign affairs, was devoted to her husband and would defend him against any ill feeling. The couple were the parents of three children, all of whom survived her, as did six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. She was also noted for her passion for Scrabble and for her independent spirit, at 85 telling off a teenage mugger who attempted to rob her. Acheson died at her home in Washington, and was buried in Oak Hill Cemetery alongside her husband.

Acheson worked in pastels, watercolor, and oils during her career, progressing from a representational style to something approaching abstraction. Four of her works are in the collection of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, part of the original bequest by Joseph Hirshhorn; they include a still-life in oil, dated before 1956; an undated landscape in oil; a 1975 watercolor view of Phnom Penh; and a 1970 collage titled ""The City"". Two undated watercolors are owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Other pieces are owned by the Phillips Collection, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Her work was formerly in the collection of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and may be found as well at American University and in the Barnett-Aden Collection. Several of her linoleum cut prints were used to illustrate ""New Roads in Old Virginia"" by Agnes Rothberg in 1937. A vertical file pertaining to Acheson's work is at the library of the Phillips Collection; other papers may be found with her husband's private documents at the Yale University Library.

Demirdjian published a 2005 paper with Rodney Dixon, a member of Association of Defence Counsel of the ICTY, about plea-bargaining at the ICTY, where they noted that defense attorneys advising clients must be extremely resourceful in exploring all possible grounds for mitigation given the broad discretionary powers of the Trial Chambers. They noted that sentence reductions were unlikely due to the serious nature of the crimes brought before the Trial Chambers, adding that in most cases, the Trial Chambers would follow the recommendations of the OTP. They identified several key ""mitigating circumstances"" including the resources of the tribunal, protecting the interests of the victims and a genuine admission of guilt.

In 1870 as the work of the ADMC was expanding led to the creation of a department with supporting researchers and clerical staff being established. In 1956 specific functions of the Central Metallurgical Laboratory transferred to the department when it was re-styled as the Central Dockyard Laboratory. In 1977 it merged with Admiralty Marine Technology Establishment but remained a sub-division of that organisation. It provided Support Services for fleet and shore establishments, including metallurgy, chemistry, biology, paint technology and reactor chemistry research.

At the age of 7 Renan moved with his mother to the United States and started bodyboarding once he was 10 on the famous beach of The Wedge in California. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks Renan moved back with his family to Brazil where he began to take bodyboarding seriously and made it a goal to make a living out of the sport.
He started to compete when he was 15 and won junior division, amateur and professional competitions of São Paulo-Brasil nationals.

He also won best trick and placed 3rd on the shore break championship at Rio de Janeiro in 2009 as the youngest athlete in the competition that included some of the best bodyboarders in Brazil.

He got sponsored by European brand Respect Bodyboards and Deluxe Fins where he eventually developed his own Pro Model signature Board and Fins that began selling worldwide.

On the age of 19 Renan decided to stop competiting and start focusing on free style bodyboarding, making videos and gaining recognition.

In 2015 Renan won the third event of the Free Surf Bodyboarding World Tour with a total of 34% of the public and judge votes.

In 2015 Renan launched the Slasher Pull, a machine designed by him as the first portable winch made for bodyboard tow outs and that resists salt water and sand, capable of pulling athletes at 50 km/h with a rope within seconds to hit waves and perform big tricks even in small waves, changing what you can do with a bodyboard in bad wave conditions. The Slasher Pull 2.0 was later developed and began being sold worldwide.

429,The Forgotten It Begins,430,game,15,"The Forgotten: It Begins

The Forgotten: It Begins is a 1999 non-violent adventure/puzzle video game developed by Ransom Interactive and published by DreamCatcher Interactive. A sequel was to be released called The Forgotten II: The Collection. ""The Forgotten"" narrative was originally supposed to last over 7 games (""modules""), but these were never completed.

The concept of serialisation was decided early on in the development of ""The Forgotten"" storyline in 1995 - a franchise that runs over seven games (""modules""). The genre of game was due to the response from customers regarding Dreamcatcher's earlier titles ""Beyond Time"" and ""Jewels of the Oracle"", which expressed a desire for ""non-violent, adventure/puzzle style games"".

The website went live on October 19, 1999. The unreleased game , announced on October 21, 1999, was to be based on a character from ""The Forgotten""; a multi-level demo was planned for E3 in the spring of 2000, but did not materialize. The game shipped on November 15, 1999 to EBX, Babbages, Microcenter and other stores, and could also be purchased online off Dreamcatcher Games Online Store.

""The Forgotten II: The Collection"" picked up where the original left off plot-wise. The narrative was originally supposed to be covered in 7 games; by April 2000, complete storyline for all seven modules had been fully developed, and the story arcs and puzzles for Episodes 2 and 3 were completed. At this time, the modeling and artwork has begun, and the game interface had been reworked to allow for larger panoramas and puzzles. A new gaming engine was also being developed for better flexibility and performance in Forgotten II and future games. The first two titles were to be released on single CDs, while the 3rd-7th were to be targeted for DVD. 

The objective of the game is to find Richard Haliburton, who has gone missing in the city of New Orleans.

While critics appreciated the game's atmosphere and approachability, as well as its intriguing premise, the game was also criticized for its short length and poorly-developed story.

431,Thomas Francis Hyland,432,hyland,17,"Thomas Francis Hyland

Thomas Francis Hyland (c. 1831 – 1 March 1920) was a businessman of Victoria, Australia, instrumental in turning Penfolds Wines from a cottage industry to an Australian icon.

Thomas Francis Hyland was born in Ireland, the youngest son of John Hyland, of Ballinamallard, Ireland.
He migrated to Australia at the time of the gold rush, worked at the diggings, and in 1853 gained employment as a warder at Pentridge Stockade then the hulk ""President"", was promoted to chief warder of the hulk ""Success"", was transferred to Collingwood Stockade, then governor of Portland Gaol, finally to become around 1868 the notoriously hard-driving governor of Castlemaine Gaol.

On 24 September 1862, he married Mary Georgina Anne ""Georgina"" Penfold, only child of Dr. Christopher Rawson Penfold (2 August 1811 – 26 March 1870) and Mary Penfold, née Holt (1816 – 31 December 1895) of ""The Grange"", Magill.
The Hylands' daughter Inez Kathleen Hyland was born 16 August 1863, and from age eight lived with her grandmother at The Grange, Magill. She was not a strong child, and her parents believed the clear air and moderate climate of Magill would be beneficial to her health. A strong bond grew between the two: Inez was a brilliant and imaginative child and Mary encouraged her writing, especially her poetry. Even well into her late 20s, Inez seems to have no other life; perhaps she was an invalid. She died from typhoid fever on 11 January 1892, and Mary left for Melbourne shortly after, never to return. She published a collection of her granddaughter's work, as ""In Sunshine and in Shadow"" in 1893, which received some excellent, if mixed, reviews.
Hyland recommended to Mary Penfold, presumptuously some reckon, that she sell the business and retire, a not unrealistic suggestion, as the property and business had become quite valuable and the sale would enable her to live in comfort indefinitely, but she was adamant: the winery was her life, and like Ann Bickford twenty years earlier, determined to keep alive the business her husband started.
Another reading could be that Hyland, who would have known his mother-in-law well, was offering his moral support whichever route she chose.

On 14 September 1881 they signed an arrangement: that Hyland should be Penfolds' accountant and their marketing agent for Victoria, where he would continue to live, leaving Mary to run the winery, and receive 10% of profits.
Hyland, who had in 1876 taken 12 months' leave of absence in 1876 preparatory, it was thought, to retiring, finally retired from Castlemaine Gaol and the Penal Department in 1883.

Mary died in 1895; the following year some members of the family adopted the style ""Penfold Hyland"", recognising the importance of the name ""Penfold"". It later frequently appeared in print hyphenated as ""Penfold-Hyland"", but with what justification it is difficult to ascertain.

Under Hyland's guidance, the company established vineyards and wineries at McLaren Vale and Nuriootpa in South Australia, and Dalwood and Minchinbury in New South Wales and offices in Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and London. His son Frank Hyland managed the business in Sydney and Leslie Hyland in Adelaide

Georgina died at home on 27 August 1911 aged 67, and her remains were interred at Brighton General Cemetery. Thomas Francis Hyland also died at home, at the age of 88 years.

He was born in Hinhgam, Massachusetts, and was a nephew of William Sturgis, a Boston merchant. In the 1830s he was owner and captain of ships plying the California hide trade with the Hawaiian Islands. After his first wife died in Massachusetts in 1840, he became a permanent resident of Yerba Buena, taking Mexican citizenship in 1942 and marrying Ygnacio Martinez's daughter Susana. He enjoyed a close friendship with Juan Bautista Alvarado, and helped him in his efforts to secure the governorship of Alta California against a competing claim from Carlos Antonio Carrillo.

He was elected alcalde in 1844, and in that year ordered the construction of a bridge across the creek between San Francisco Bay and a small saltwater lagoon lying at what is now the intersection of Montgomery and Jackson Streets. This modest construction was regarded as a novelty by many residents at the time, who had formerly had to wade tidal muds or jump across the creek to travel between the settled area to the south and ship embarkments to the north.

Beyond Time aka Shadow of the Obelisk: Delve Into the Corridors of Time is a 1997 full motion video adventure game developed by Jones and Jones Multimedia and published by DreamCatcher Interactive.

The background of Jones and Jones Multimedia employees included theatre, fiction, literature, and art, and the company's video game output (including this game) combined these aspects together. They aimed to include genuine rt and historical information to make it appealing and long-lasting. They set the game in locations that had an air of mystery and fascination. The team spent more than a year doing art history research to have a better understanding of the architectural worlds which were being created in the game. They turned their research into 3D representations; while they didn't recreate existing structures, they incorporated elements that they observed. The team aimed to add 2D animation and sound effects to as many screens as possible to give a sense of a lived-in world, for instance a bird flying across the sky. A unique game engine was made for the title.

Quandary thought the game's short length let it down. Just Adventure and Adventure Gamers described the game as a watered-down ""Timelapse-""type experience. Game Revolution thought the graphics were underwhelming. Adventure Classic Gaming criticised the game's ""plodding, chatty, confused storyline"". Computer Gaming World said it ""wants to be ""Myst"""" and fails at it. PC PowerPlay deemed the game a ""dry, humorless, dull, and pretty monotonous"" Myst-clone.

468,Oman–Saudi Arabia relations,469,saudi,14,"Oman–Saudi Arabia relations

Oman–Saudi Arabia relations refers to the current and historical relations between Sultanate of Oman and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Oman has an embassy in Riyadh and a consulate in Jeddah, whilst Saudi Arabia has an embassy in Muscat.

Two nations have a long historical relationship between two states. Both are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and mainly adhere to Islam, although Oman is Ibadi Islam while Saudi Arabia is Wahhabi Islam. As such, unlike radical approach of Saudi Arabia, Oman has a moderate and friendly approach, which makes Oman capable to handle the political hardship between Saudi Arabia and several nations, especially Iran.

The two countries share a long border only behind Saudi-Yemen border.

The Khawarij, a radical Islamic group formed after the death of Prophet Muhammad in what would be today Saudi Arabia, was responsible for the revolt against Caliph Ali. However, some of them, following the more moderate and disagreed with the Khawarij, refused the authority of Khawarij and moved into South Arabia, which would be today Oman. Thus, the moderate party formed the Ibadi movement, in which later became the core of Omani culture. The Ibadi is the only surviving force of the Khawarij movement.

As both Oman and Saudi Arabia's modern political approach formed amidst the withdrawal of British Armed Forces, they established relationship at 1971. However, Oman has chosen a moderate approach in political agenda in comparing to Saudi Arabia. Oman has been acting as a mediator that keeping relationship with Iran when Iran has tensions with other Arab countries, and since then has become a bridge connecting relationship between two countries. Also, Oman doesn't participate in the Saudi-led coalition at the Yemeni Civil War.

Recently, Oman also plays as moderate mediator during the current standoff between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and provides an alternative route to bypass the blockade of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies.",oman saudi arabia relat oman saudi arabia relat refer current histor relat sultan oman kingdom saudi arabia. oman embassi riyadh consul jeddah saudi arabia embassi muscat. nation long histor relationship states. member gulf cooper council adher islam oman ibadi islam saudi arabia wahhabi islam. radic approach saudi arabia oman moder friendli approach oman capabl handl polit hardship saudi arabia nation iran. countri share long border saudi yemen border. khawarij radic islam group form death prophet muhammad today saudi arabia respons revolt caliph ali. moder disagre khawarij refus author khawarij move south arabia today oman. moder parti form ibadi movement core omani culture. ibadi surviv forc khawarij movement. oman saudi arabia modern polit approach form withdraw british arm forc establish relationship 1971. oman chosen moder approach polit agenda compar saudi arabia. oman act mediat keep relationship iran iran tension arab countri bridg connect relationship countries. oman particip saudi lead coalit yemeni civil war. oman play moder mediat current standoff qatar saudi arabia altern rout bypass blockad qatar saudi arabia allies.

The VDL Citea is a city bus of the Dutch bus manufacturer VDL Bus & Coach. A demonstration bus was presented at the 'UITP Mobility and City Transport Exhibition 2007' in Helsinki. The Citea is sold in three different variants, as low entry bus (CLE, Citea Low Entry), as a light-weight low-entry bus (LLE, Light Low Entry), and as a low-floor bus with tower engine (CLF, Citea Low Floor). A variant as a double-decker bus (DLF, Double Deck Low Floor) exists as a prototype and is since August 2015 at the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) in trial. 2010 was a facelift.

The first 10 Citea were ordered in 2008 by Connexxion. On November 10, 2008, a large contract for 518 VDL Citea was announced by the RTA from Dubai, the first Citea were delivered to Dubai on June 29, 2009.

On April 11, 2011, VDL announced that GVB Amsterdam had ordered 70 Citea.

In January 2013, VDL received an order for 60 Citea LLEs from Rheinbahn. The two test vehicles of the lightweight model previously achieved higher fuel savings in a two-year test than a hybrid vehicle, which was also tested by the Rheinbahn in the same period.

In 2014, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG) signed a supply contract with VDL for up to 236 VDL Citea, which was to modernize the fleet of Berlin's public transport companies by 2019. The first 40 vehicles were delivered in 2015, until 2016, the delivery of another 70 vehicles. In October 2016, the BVG announced not to retrieve all 236 vehicles from the contract. It remains with the 110 previously delivered vehicles. A justification why not all vehicles are retrieved from the supply contract has not been formally named.

Due to its cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness, the Citea was named Bus of the Year 2011 at the IAA in Hanover on 23 September 2010.
On December 1, 2010, two CLF120 Hybrid hybrid Citeas from Connexxion were presented in Enschede. The hybrid technology comes from Vossloh-Kiepe. The bus was constructed using TU Darmstadt. In March 2011, therefore, 3 Citea SLF120Hybrid were delivered to the HEAG mobibus.

483,Old Wolfstein Castle,484,castl,13,"Old Wolfstein Castle

Old Wolfstein Castle (, also called the ""Altes Schloß""), is a ruined hillside castle on the eastern slopes of the Königsberg at the narrowest point in the Lauter valley near Wolfstein in the county of Kusel in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

Old Wolfstein was probably built under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa around 1160/70 to guard and administer the Imperial Estate around Kaiserslautern.

The castle is first recorded in 1275 as ""Woluistein"". At that time it was occupied by imperial ""ministeriales"".

In the 14th century the castle acted as security (""Pfandobjekt""), and, as an imperial pledge (""Reichspfand""), ended up in the possession of the counts of Sponheim and counts of Veldenz. Baldwin of Luxembourg made several unsuccessful attempts to acquired the castle through an imperial mortgage (""Reichspfandschaft"").

Repeated raids on the castle defenders, who came from Sponheim ""ministeriales"" families, led to armed conflicts. In 1362 the Bishop of Speyer occupied the castle; in 1400 the Archbishops of Mainz and Trier, the Duke of Lorraine and Count Palatine Rupert III besiegd the castle. As a consequence, Electoral Palatinate received a quarter of the castle.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Electoral Palatinate and the Duchy of Zweibrücken fought for possession of the castle.
The dispute ended in 1504 with its destruction by Prince-Elector Philip of the Palatinate. After that, Old Wolfstein was allowed to fall into ruin.

In the 19th and 20th centuries the ruins came into the possssion of the Kingdom of Bavaria and, since 1963, have been managed by the Castle Authorities of Rhineland-Palatinate (""Schlösserverwaltung von Rheinland-Pfalz""). The latter carried out safety work on the walls in the years 1979 to 1981 and 1985 to 1986. The remains of the castle ruins include a 20-metre-high ""bergfried"".

From the platform of the pentangular ""bergfried"" there is a very good view of the surrounding area. The walls of the small cast are a well preserved example of High Hohenstaufen architecture. Another feature of this design is the elongated tip of the side of the ""bergfried"" facing the likely direction of attack. To the north of the ruins on a steep hillside is rubble from an old wall, which is evidence of the formerly, lower lying outer ward of the castle. From 1961 to 1975 remains of a castle residence (""Burghaus""), a gate tower and a water well were uncovered.

A close observation of the interior wall of the ruined ""bergfried"" reveals at a certain height the handle and rear part of a trowel. This tool was probably embedded there by workmen in memory of a colleague who fell and was killed during restoration work. This trowel is supposed to have been worked into the wall at the exact height from which the man fell (the exact date must be before 1970, but cannot be more precisely estimated).",wolfstein castl wolfstein castl call alt schloß ruin hillsid castl eastern slope königsberg narrow point lauter valley wolfstein counti kusel german rhineland palatinate. wolfstein built emperor frederick barbarossa 1160 70 guard administ imperi estat kaiserslautern. castl record 1275 woluistein . time occupi imperi ministerial . 14th centuri castl act secur pfandobjekt imperi pledg reichspfand end possess count sponheim count veldenz. baldwin luxembourg unsuccess attempt acquir castl imperi mortgag reichspfandschaft . repeat raid castl defend sponheim ministerial famili lead arm conflicts. 1362 bishop speyer occupi castle; 1400 archbishop mainz trier duke lorrain count palatin rupert iii besiegd castle. consequ elector palatin receiv quarter castle. 15th 16th centuri elector palatin duchi zweibrücken fought possess castle. disput end 1504 destruct princ elector philip palatinate. wolfstein allow fall ruin. 19th 20th centuri ruin possssion kingdom bavaria 1963 manag castl author rhineland palatin schlösserverwaltung von rheinland pfalz . carri safeti work wall year 1979 1981 1985 1986. remain castl ruin includ 20 metr high bergfri . platform pentangular bergfri good view surround area. wall small cast preserv high hohenstaufen architecture. featur design elong bergfri face direct attack. north ruin steep hillsid rubbl wall evid lie outer ward castle. 1961 1975 remain castl resid burghau gate tower water uncovered. close observ interior wall ruin bergfri reveal height handl rear trowel. tool emb workman memori colleagu fell kill restor work. trowel suppos work wall exact height man fell exact 1970 cannot precis estim .

The Arab conquest at 7th century had brought Tunisia into an Islamic sphere. A mosque, which is regarded as the third holiest place in the Islamic world, the Great Mosque of Kairouan, was built in Tunisia.

Both two nations have increased significant cooperation since the independence of Tunisia from France. The Saudi Kingdom has attempted to increase their Islamic doctrine into Tunisia for several years recently.
